        "Title": "Grow Your Money: How to Apply for and Invest in Pag-IBIG MP2",
        "Body": "According to Pag-IBIG Fund Chief Executive Officer Marilene C. Acosta, the biggest growth in the agency's savings collections came from MP2 savings and contributions--more than the mandated monthly savings. Indeed, from January to September 2023, Pag-IBIG MP2 savings reached P35.13 billion, a 14% growth from the P30.81 billion collected as of September 2022.[1] After all, the competitive returns offered by MP2 make it one of the best options to grow your hard-earned money. In this article, you'll understand more about why it's an investment worth considering. Learn how to apply for and invest in Pag-IBIG MP2. What is Pag-IBIG MP2? The Modified Pag-IBIG II or MP2 is an optional savings program with a five-year maturity for current and former Pag-IBIG Fund members. It's designed for those who want to grow their savings and earn higher dividends in addition to their Pag-IBIG regular savings. The MP2 program makes saving and investing money easy, affordable, and profitable for Filipinos. Check out some basic information about the savings program: Budget-friendly investment - For as low as P500 monthly, you can invest in MP2. No penalties if you miss a contribution for certain months (though it's best to regularly remit your MP2 contributions). Government-guaranteed savings - You won't lose your principal since the Philippine government guarantees it. But your savings may be subject to a different computation scheme considering annual dividend performance and other factors. Tax-free dividends - Receive your MP2 dividends without tax deductions either every year or in five years. High dividend rate - The Pag-IBIG MP2 interest rate is higher than that of the regular Pag-IBIG savings program and even those of bank accounts, time deposits, and other investment vehicles. No limit to the amount you can save - Remit as much money into your MP2 account as your budget allows. For one-time payments exceeding P500,000, a personal/manager's check is required. Multiple MP2 savings accounts - You can open as many MP2 accounts as you'd like. This is ideal if you're saving money for different goals, like emergencies, tuition, travel, retirement, etc. Five-year maturity period - Your MP2 savings will mature in five years, after which you can withdraw your money. This makes the MP2 savings program ideal for medium-term investment goals. What are the Advantages of the MP2 Program? Like any other investment vehicle, the MP2 Savings Program offers a lot of benefits for its investors. Here's what you need to know.  High Annual Interest Rate and Low Required ADB The MP2 program can let you earn as much as 7.03% of your savings fund per year compared to other high-yield savings accounts. Check out this table comparing the interest rates of Pag-IBIG MP2 with the rates of banks. The MP2's average daily balance to earn interest is computed by multiplying the minimum monthly remittance of P500 by 12 months. Although the total average daily balance required to earn interest may be higher compared to a few other banks, the average annual interest is way higher.  Option to Withdraw Dividends Each Year or Compound for 5 Years MP2 allows you to withdraw your dividends each year or to add them to your savings account to earn compounded interest. If you choose to withdraw it directly to your bank account, you can use the money to fund essentials or emergencies. On the other hand, if you have it compounded for five years, expect to earn more from your savings. You can also reinvest after the five-year maturity period.  Option to Withdraw Your Money Anytime Although the MP2 savings can be maintained for five years, you still have the option to withdraw your money anytime in case of emergencies.  Easy Account Opening Online By filling out the online Pag-IBIG MP2 online registration form, you can automatically enroll and start paying your contributions anytime.

How much is the Pag-IBIG MP2 contribution? The minimum amount you can save in your MP2 account is P500 per month. This makes Pag-IBIG's savings program one of the most affordable for Filipinos who want to start investing small. 2. Where are contributions invested? MP2 contributions paid by Pag-IBIG members are invested in Pag-IBIG housing loans (which earn interest paid by member-borrowers), government securities, and corporate bonds. Investing money in fixed securities makes the Pag-IBIG MP2 investment less risky compared to stocks and other high-risk instruments. 3. How much dividends will I earn from my MP2 savings? The annual MP2 dividends you'll receive will depend on the dividend rate set by Pag-IBIG for a particular year during your investment term. The annual rates vary depending on Pag-IBIG Fund's financial performance and other factors. According to a sample MP2 computation at the Pag-IBIG website,[6] if you've been saving P500 from 2020 to 2024, you're likely to receive a total dividend of P5,718.75 (if you chose to get your dividends annually). Your total dividend will be higher at P6,266.14 if you opt to get paid the lump sum after your MP2 account's five-year term. 4. What is the interest rate of Pag-IBIG MP2 this 2024? The latest Pag-IBIG MP2 dividend rate (as of 2022) is 7.03% per annum.[7] 5. How will I receive my MP2 dividends? You can claim your MP2 Savings after its five-year maturity through the Virtual Pag-IBIG facility. You can also claim it in person. Fill out the Application for Provident Benefits form[8] and submit it to the nearest Pag-IBIG Fund branch. 6. Can I withdraw my MP2 savings before its maturity? Ideally, like with other investments in the Philippines, it's best to let the funds in your MP2 account grow until your account matures. This way, you get to maximize your profits. However, an unfortunate life situation might make withdrawing your MP2 savings necessary. The Pag-IBIG Fund allows early withdrawal under scenarios such as the following: Total disability or insanity Termination from employment due to health reasons Death/critical illness of the MP2 account holder or an immediate family member Retirement Migration to another country Unemployment due to layoff or company closure OFW repatriation from the host country You may withdraw your savings for a reason other than those allowed by Pag-IBIG. But you'll only receive half of the total dividend earned (if you chose to receive dividends after five years) or only your contributions (if you chose the annual dividend payout option). 7. Can I enroll a new MP2 savings account after maturity? Yes, you can open new MP2 savings accounts once your existing account matures. This is a good strategy if you wish to invest your money in the long term, like for retirement. 8. What will happen if I don't claim my dividends? Unclaimed MP2 savings after the five-year maturity will keep earning dividends based on the dividend rates of the Pag-IBIG Regular Savings Program. After two years, it will no longer earn dividends. You should just withdraw your contributions. 9. What happens if I decide to pre-terminate my account? Pag-IBIG allows for account pre-termination. However, the payouts differ depending on the circumstance: If the reason for pre-termination is a total disability, retirement, or any other reasons stipulated by Pag-IBIG, you can withdraw your entire savings plus 50% of the dividends earned. But if the reason for pre-termination is not listed in the MP2 Savings terms and conditions, you can withdraw your entire savings without any dividends earned. Final Thoughts Fortunately, the process of how to apply for and invest in Pag-IBIG MP2 is not that complicated. It's a good way to build your savings and fund your financial goals in the future. It makes a great passive income source, as you let a small amount of money earn for you. Since it's backed by the government, you can also rest assured that you won't lose your money. By diligently contributing each month for five years, you build not just a savings fund but a good savings habit.",

It is also a valid ID for various operations with the government and other organizations.

However, the PhilHealth regular ID card and the digitized PhilHealth ID are two different types of ID. The PhilHealth regular identification card is made of cardboard and is not laminated when it is first issued. Only a few government organizations and establishments accept it as a valid ID. On the other hand, the digitized PhilHealth Insurance Card is a wholly laminated photo ID card that is accepted as valid identification by all government organizations and other businesses. How can I apply for PhilHealth for the first time? Registering for an account is the initial step toward obtaining a PhilHealth ID. For employed members, you might not need to do this yourself because your PhilHealth membership may already have been handled by the private company you worked for.

If you're unemployed or self-employed and have never worked as an official employee, you may need to enroll as a voluntary member and request a PhilHealth ID.

Settle Past Traffic Violations driver's license renewal requirements - how to check violations Before you head to an LTO branch for your driver's license renewal, see to it that all your traffic violations have been settled. Pay your fines ahead of time. Settling the fees on the day of your renewal will delay the entire process. To check your unsettled violations online, log in to your account at the LTO online portal. Then click the Violations icon. You'll see your demerit points and unsettled apprehensions. If the system shows 0 Points and NO UNSETTLED APPREHENSIONS FOUND, congratulations! That means you're qualified for the 10-year driver's license validity.  Double-Check Your Documents If you're a walk-in applicant, fill out your application form in advance. That way, you can save time and move on to the next step of your renewal. After filling out your form, double-check the details. Any inconsistencies and inaccuracies will delay your application.  Schedule Your Medical Exam in Advance A medical certificate is one of the driver's license renewal requirements. Typically, driver's license applicants get a medical certificate when they undergo a medical examination on the day of their license renewal. To avoid standing in a long line, schedule your medical exam in advance. A few days before your appointment date, undergo a medical check-up at an LTO-accredited clinic. Getting a medical certificate for your driver's license renewal in the Philippines will cost you around P300.  Bring Snacks and Water You never know how long the queue will be. You don't know how long each renewal step will take. So bring snacks and refreshments with you. A bottle of water and some crackers will suffice.  Avoid Fixers at All Costs The whole driver's renewal process may be tedious, but that's no excuse to get a fixer. Working with a fixer isn't just an added cost--it's one way of encouraging and perpetuating corruption. You also run the risk of facing legal repercussions in case you get caught. Final Thoughts Now you know the driver's license renewal requirements and process in the Philippines! While the LTO has implemented some improvements, you must still manage your expectations and plan things well. You might just get your hands on your new driver's license sooner than expected.",

When it comes to registrations processed by dealers, customers are now empowered by the LTO to monitor and report delays. According to a memorandum from the agency,[1] dealers are required to display the processing time of vehicle registration. The said memorandum also breaks down the vehicle registration procedure with dealers into five steps: The owner purchases the vehicle and submits the requirements. Within two to three days, the dealer should process the requirements. The dealer should report the sale and initial registration process in one to two days. The LTO will register the purchased vehicle and release the license plate number and the Certificate of Registration.

Once it expires, you need to renew on schedule to avoid a weekly fine of P200. For a month's delay in payment, the fine will be 50% of the Motor Vehicle User's Charge (MVUC). Additionally, if you get caught driving an unregistered vehicle, you'll pay a hefty fine of P10,000. You'll incur more penalties if you don't renew your car registration right away, which is why the LTO constantly issues reminders to all vehicle owners regarding their car registration renewal.  What is the Schedule for LTO Car Registration Renewal? However, you can't simply drive to an LTO office and apply for a vehicle renewal. So how to know when to renew your car registration? The LTO uses a plate number-based system to determine when to renew car registration in the Philippines. The last digit of your plate number corresponds to the month you need to renew your vehicle. Month Last Digit of Your Plate Number January 1 February 2 March 3 April 4 May 5 June 6 July 7 August 8 September 9 October 0 The second to the last digit of your plate number, on the other hand, corresponds to the weekly deadline for your car registration renewal.

With this scheme, you can easily plan your renewal. There shouldn't be an excuse, as everything is dictated by your plate number. To avoid hassles and delays, you can also renew your car registration a month before its deadline.

Your vehicle just needs to go through an inspection and emission test to acquire a Certificate of Emission Compliance (CEC). Note that as per an LTO memorandum,[3] car owners no longer need to undergo engine and chassis number stenciling for plain vehicle registration renewal, provided that the vehicle passes the roadworthiness inspection and that the details on the CR match those on the vehicle. As for the servicing LTO branch, you can renew your car registration at any LTO online district/extension office. How to Do LTO Car Registration Renewal Online lto car registration renewal - lto online portal Don't want to have to spend long hours at the LTO office just to renew your vehicle's registration? Good news--you can now do it online via the Land Transportation Management System (LTMS) portal. The process is quick and easy--online LTO registration renewal via the portal should take less than 10 minutes.[4] Wondering, \"How do I renew my LTO registration online?\" Here's what to do: Get a Certificate of Coverage (COC) from the insurance company of your choice. The said insurance company will then electronically transmit the COC to the LTMS. Bring your vehicle to a Private Motor Vehicle Inspection Center (PMVIC) to check its roadworthiness. The PMVIC will then electronically transmit the inspection report to the LTMS. Log in to the LTMS portal to start the online renewal registration of your motor vehicle. You don't have to input the COC and PMVIC details anymore, as they're already encoded in the form. Pay the fees online. The system will then generate a receipt and send it to your email. Congratulations, your vehicle registration is renewed! Keep in mind, however, that the LTO registration online comes with the following conditions: The LTO registration renewal online is applicable only to plain renewals. The client should be an individual or a member of an organization with an account in the LTO portal for car registration. The previous vehicle renewal transaction was accomplished using the LTMS. The vehicle due for renewal must be linked to the registered LTMS account. The vehicle owner registered in the Certificate of Registration should be the current owner. The Certificate of Coverage (insurance) must be validated and transmitted by the Insurance Commission. As noted in the procedure, the inspection report must be issued by the PMVIC. The details of the vehicle must be updated to include the latest plate issuance.  LTO Renewal Fees The fees for LTO renewal are the same as that of the initial registration, but you also have to pay a renewal fee of P400.

You also have to submit your Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC) or Order for Dropping and Substitution (Change Classification) if your vehicle is for hire. Step 2: Pay the Corresponding Fees Per the Department of Transportation (DoTr), the cost of a vehicle inspection should be the same as that of an emission test given by a private emission testing center. This means that the fee will depend on the testing center of your choice.[5] Step 3: Undergo Vehicle Inspection An inspector will take a look at your vehicle and conduct an emission test for the inspection report. An approving officer will confirm the accuracy of the report. Step 4: Receive Your Inspection Report and Requirements Head over to the releasing clerk to accept your MVIR and returned requirements. If you fail the inspection report, you'll be asked to correct your vehicle's defect and return for re-inspection.

Should you go for the former, make sure they are truly accredited and authorized by the LTO. LTO Car Registration and Renewal Tips Manage your expectations and curb the stress of LTO car registration and renewal with the following helpful pointers: Before you go to any LTO branch, make sure you have an LTO Client ID as proof that you've successfully registered to the LTMS public portal. Note that using the LTO portal for car registration is free of charge, so don't engage with anyone offering to do it for you for a fee. Be early. It's best to come before 8:00 a.m. to avoid long lines. Note that some applicants go to the LTO as early as six in the morning. Don't forget to bring your early warning device (EWD). The EWD is a mandatory car accessory (except for motorcycles and tricycles). You might be asked to show it during your vehicle inspection. Keep your car in good running condition to prepare it for inspection. Hold on to your documents and receipts to avoid delaying the process. Avoid fixers or individuals impersonating or claiming to be LTO officers. Otherwise, you may face legal repercussions. Prepare loose change for the photocopier. Bring your own pen. Bring a book or an entertainment device to pass the time. LTO Car Registration and Renewal: FAQs lto car registration renewal - faqs Got more questions on LTO car registration and renewal?

        "Title": "SSS Pension Booster Announced: What is it? How to Benefit from it? All Details",
        "Body": "SSS Pension Booster Announced The WASP and WASP Plus changes highlight the program's goal of enhancing its members' retirement funds. Ronaldo Ledesma Macasaet, the SSS President and CEO, emphasised that these saving schemes are part of reforms introduced under Republic Act No. 11199, also known as the Social Security Act of 2018. The MySSS Pension Booster comprises mandatory and voluntary schemes. Joy A. Villacorta, SSS Vice President for the Benefits Administration Division, explained that mandatory schemes automatically enrol members contributing to the regular SSS program. This scheme allows members to save beyond the usual threshold, ensuring SSS manages their contributions and earnings securely. On the other hand, the voluntary scheme enables interested members to enrol through their MySSS accounts. Contributions start as low as P500 per payment, offering flexibility and growth over time. Villacorta highlighted that the members could withdraw their contributions and invest earnings in response to urgent needs, though staying enrolled for at least five years will maximize earnings potential. The MySSS Booster is not just a retirement saving plan; it is designed to be a safe, convenient and nontaxable investment opportunity for all Filipinos. It supplements members' savings under the Regular SSS program, which aims to provide a comfortable retirement. Villacorta emphasises that members have the option to opt for total contributions plus the interest while claiming retirement, total disability, or death benefits under the Regular SSS program. Regarding membership coverage, Villacorta emphasised that the Regular SSS Program is mandatory for private sector employees earning from PHP 20,000 to PHP 30,000 monthly. Meanwhile, the MySSS Pension Booster included mandatory contributions from their employees and employers, further strengthening retirement savings. The SSS encourages Filipinos to participate in the MySSS Pension Booster to enhance their financial security. At the relaunch event for the MySSS Pension Booster at the SSS headquarters in Quezon City, various professionals, including overseas Filipinos, Mariners, Self-employed individuals, and corporate executives, were present. Macasaet underscores the importance of early retirement planning, urging members to prioritize building their retirement funds early with SSS's assistance. The participant can invest P500 in the MySSS Pension Booster plan or make higher investments to grow their fund with time. Interested individuals can navigate to the SSS's leading portal and must sign up to contribute. Once you have your MySSS account, you can invest in the MySSS Pension Booster and enjoy the invested fund to enjoy your retirement. The key to a happy retirement is to laser focus on the most important input that affects the output. With regards to saving, you need to identify your reason for saving. In a nutshell, the MySSS Pension Booster represents a significant step towards strengthening retirement planning among the citizens. By rebranding and enhancing the savings schemes, the SSS aims to serve diverse professional groups and ensure members can comfortably achieve their retirement goals. For those considering their future financial security, the MySSS Pension Booster offers a feasible option to build and grow retirement funds with the support and reliability of the SSS. Investing early is crucial for everyone as it allows taking advantage of compound interest's power. Compound interest is the interest on interest, which is the key to building wealth over time. The Scheme also offers an estimated 7.2 per cent compound annual growth rate. To collect more relevant information on the SSS Pension Plan, kindly visit our main page.",

        "Title": "PERA in the Philippines: Enjoy Tax Incentives and Comfortable Retirement",
        "Body": "The problem with retirement planning in the Philippines--aside from the lack of it--is the limited investment choices available for Filipinos who want to save up for when they retire. Addressing that challenge, the government offers the Personal Equity and Retirement Account or PERA as an additional source of retirement income to help Filipinos achieve a comfortable and financially secure retirement. Will a PERA investment suit your retirement goals? Here's a guide to help you decide whether it's worth investing in PERA and how to open a PERA account in the Philippines. What is PERA Investment? PERA is a long-term and tax-free voluntary retirement investment program in the Philippines that was created through Republic Act 9505.[1] Think of PERA as the Roth IRA or 401k equivalent in the Philippines. In the U.S., a Roth IRA is a special Individual Retirement Account (IRA) for which you pay taxes on money going in and then enjoy tax-free future withdrawals;[2] while a 401(k) is a workplace retirement plan that lets you make annual contributions up to a certain limit.[3] The PERA law encourages Filipinos to save money for retirement through generous tax benefits for investment earnings held for five years or longer until age 55. This individual retirement account in the Philippines is designed as an additional retirement savings option. PERA savings supplement rather than replace GSIS or SSS pensions and retirement pay from private employers. Who Can Create a PERA Account? pera account philippines - who can create a pera account Filipinos aged 18 and above with a Tax Identification Number (TIN), whether employed or self-employed, may open a PERA account. Below are the basic eligibility criteria and requirements: Filipino and at least 18 years old (below 18 years old can open a PERA account through a guardian) Has a source of income Has a Tax Identification Number (TIN) Owns a current or savings account from a PERA administrator bank Valid IDs (Driver's License, Passport, UMID, SSS ID, etc.) Latest copy of Income Tax Return (ITR) How Much Can I Invest in PERA? You can start investing in PERA for as low as P1,000. But each PERA investor in the Philippines may contribute up to P200,000 every year,[4] while OFWs can invest up to P400,000 yearly. Note that you can invest more, but any excess amount is not eligible for tax relief. Why Should I Open a PERA Retirement Fund? pera account philippines - why should i open a fund Compared to regular savings accounts and time deposits, a PERA retirement plan yields higher investment returns because it provides tax exemptions on investment income and allows investors to choose investment products that fit their needs and risk appetite.  Higher Investment Returns Through Tax Benefits PERA investors enjoy the following tax advantages: Income tax credit - You'll get a 5% tax credit on your total annual PERA contributions. You can use this tax credit to pay your income tax liabilities. Let's say your income tax is P150,000, and your total PERA contribution is P100,000. Because you're entitled to a 5% tax credit of P5,000, you'll pay only P145,000 in income tax for the year. Tax-free investment income - Looking for tax-free investments in the Philippines? As a PERA , you'll be exempted from final withholding taxes, capital gains tax, and regular income tax. Exemption from estate tax - In case of the PERA contributor's death, the money will be released to the heirs or legal beneficiaries without paying estate taxes and going through the lengthy probate process.  Ability to Choose PERA Investment Products Unlike with GSIS/SSS and Pag-IBIG contributions, you have control over where to invest your money as a PERA contributor. You can grow your retirement savings in different PERA investment products that suit your risk profile, whether conservative, moderate, or aggressive. For example, young investors in their 20s or 30s can beat inflation and maximize their returns by putting their money in high-risk investment vehicles such as a PERA equity fund. Those with conservative to moderate risk appetites can opt for a PERA money market fund or a PERA bond fund. What are the Disadvantages of a PERA Investment? Any investment, such as a PERA account, has its drawbacks. Here are some you should take note of.  Investment Risks Like other investment types, PERA comes with certain risks, depending on your chosen investment product. For example, investing in a PERA equity fund exposes the investor to the usual risks of a stock investment, like fluctuating stock prices. The risks associated with your PERA investment product will be explained when you open a PERA account. Make sure to understand the risks before you sign the dotted line.  Penalties for Early Withdrawals Wondering when you can withdraw your PERA investments? Because you're investing for retirement through PERA, you can only touch your funds once you're 55 and you've contributed for five years or longer. The amount can be paid in a lump sum or as a monthly pension for a lifetime or a certain period. Earlier than that, you can fully or partially withdraw your PERA contributions, but you'll no longer enjoy the tax incentives. Exempted from early withdrawal penalties are PERA contributors with a permanent disability or those hospitalized for over 30 days due to an accident or illness.  Administrator Fee and Other Service Fees Investing in PERA comes with additional costs. You'll pay a 1% administrator fee plus 0.5% to 1.5% trust and custodian fees for every contribution. To minimize these fees, pay a lump sum yearly rather than making monthly contributions. Learn more about whether you should invest in PERA in this video by financial planner and entrepreneur Marvin Germo: Where are PERA Contributions Invested? PERA contributions may be invested in the following: Unit investment trust funds (UITFs) Mutual funds Government securities Annuity contracts Exchange-traded bonds Insurance pension products Pre-need pension plans Shares of stocks listed and traded in the Philippine Stock Exchange Other investment products authorized for PERA purposes How Much Can I Earn from a PERA Investment? pera account philippines - how much can i earn The earnings you will receive from a PERA investment in the Philippines depends on your choice of investments. Different products have different returns. When you invest in something with the potential for higher returns, your investment also faces a higher risk. On the other hand, modest risks usually mean modest returns. How to Invest in PERA Philippines To start your PERA investment, you must open a PERA account through an administrator. You can visit banks, financial institutions, trust entities, investment companies, stock brokerages, and insurance companies accredited by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Insurance Commission. When you open a PERA account, you can start making contributions through your bank account with your chosen administrator or via over-the-counter cash or check payments.  PERA Investment Account Requirements Here are some of the basic requirements you will need to submit when opening a PERA account: A savings or checking account with any bank One valid ID Tax Identification Number (TIN) Copy of latest Income Tax Return (ITR) or any document that can validate the TIN Initial investment (starts at P1,000)  How to Open a PERA Account in the Philippines Visit a branch where PERA is available.

        "Title": "Work, Invest, Save, and Prosper: SSS WISP vs WISP Plus",
        "Body": "The SSS has been heavily promoting its concept of \"work, save, invest, and prosper.\" With the effects of the pandemic and inflation on the Philippine economy, it's not easy to find a savings and investment plan that's affordable, safe, flexible, and even tax-free. The Social Security System (SSS)'s WISP is one of your options. In this article, learn more about your WISP SSS contributions and WISP Plus, SSS' new retirement savings program. What is WISP in SSS Contributions? wisp sss contributions - what is wisp So what is WISP in SSS for? Is WISP mandatory? The meaning of WISP in SSS is Worker's Investment and Savings Program. The SSS implemented the WISP in January 2021 as part of the SS Law amendment in 2018. It's a compulsory provident fund program for SSS members whose contributions to the regular program under the Monthly Salary Credit (MSC) exceed P20,000. The WISP covers contributions over the P20,000 MSC and up to the prescribed maximum MSC. Self-employed, voluntary, and OFW members must shoulder WISP contributions on their own. It's a safe and convenient way to contribute to your individual retirement fund or savings plan. Moreover, your principal is protected, and it's tax-free. This means that aside from the regular SSS pension you'll receive upon retirement, your WISP contributions will provide an additional source of retirement benefits. Check out the WISP SSS contribution tables below: For regular employers and employees wisp sss contributions - for regular employers and employees For self-employed members wisp sss contribution - for self-employed members  SSS WISP Benefits On top of the benefits under the regular SSS program, WISP benefits include retirement pensions and total disability and death benefits. Here are other perks you can enjoy with this program:  Affordable, Safe, and Convenient According to the SSS, WISP generated an income of P333.77 million, with a corresponding return of 6.39%, in its first year of implementation.[1] It's an easy and secure way to boost your retirement savings. Your WISP contributions earn competitive interest that compounds until your retirement. Your principal is protected, your contributions are guaranteed preserved, and you enjoy tax-free earnings.  Offers Higher Additional Benefits Upon Retirement Because you're paying your WISP and your regular SSS contributions, you can boost your savings and retirement fund faster.

The sooner you start contributing to SSS and WISP, the more significant your retirement benefits will be. See how your WISP savings and benefits can grow: wisp sss contribution - higher additional benefits  Receive Your Benefit in Lump Sum or Annuity With the WISP, you will receive your benefits in lump sum or annuity, depending on how your SSS benefit in the regular program will be paid. If you choose to receive it in annuity, you'll receive a fixed monthly pension until your total accumulated account value (AV) is fully settled. It will cover at least 15 years.  The Downside of WISP Your total accumulated AV will be the basis of your additional benefits, which will be given at the same time as your retirement or total disability or death benefits. Thus, your WISP earnings will be based on your contributions. If you only made a small contribution to WISP, the benefits will only equal the contributions made. Also, unlike SSS programs such as the PESO and the Flexi-Fund Program for OFWs, where you can make an early withdrawal or refund, WISP benefits will only be released when you make a final benefit claim. Note: PESO and Flexi-Fund will soon be part of the WISP Plus Program.  How to Apply for WISP in SSS If you're employed in the private sector, self-employed, an OFW, or a voluntary member with a monthly salary higher than P20,000 and no final claim made in the regular SSS program, you're automatically enrolled in and contributing to WISP. What is WISP Plus? Unlike the WISP, which is mandatory for SSS members who meet the criteria, WISP Plus is a voluntary retirement savings program for SSS members in addition to the regular SSS program. It allows members to save and invest in an affordable, tax-free savings scheme while enjoying additional social security protection. WISP Plus earns more than regular savings and time deposits. You can receive additional benefits when you retire. The priority of WISP Plus is capital preservation, so the following limits will guide its initial investment mix: At least 15% in government securities, which can be increased up to 100% of the investments Up to 20% in corporate/multilateral institutions and equities Up to 25% in short- and medium-term loans to WISP Plus members (calamity, salary, livelihood loans, etc.) Up to 40% in money market and BSP-approved investment instruments Up to 70% in loans to pensioners  How Much is the Minimum Investment in WISP Plus? The minimum contribution is P500 per payment.  Who Can Enroll in WISP Plus? The WISP Plus is open to all SSS members, regardless of their membership type, declared monthly earnings, and last posted monthly salary credit (MSC).[2] Employed members must have at least one posted regular SSS contribution within the last three months. On the other hand, self-employed, OFW, and voluntary members must have a posted regular SSS contribution for the current applicable payment month. But like the WISP, members shouldn't have claimed any final benefits, like total disability or retirement, to qualify for the program.  How to Enroll in WISP Plus If you want to enroll in WISP Plus, you can do so online. Enrollment to WISP Plus is only done once, and your membership to the program will not expire. wisp sss contribution - how to enroll wisp plus Log in to your My.SSS account.

Pros and cons of acquired assets Because of their below-market price, Pag-IBIG Acquired Assets may seem like a steal if you're looking for affordable property. But before you buy, it's important to weigh the pros and cons of purchasing an acquired asset. Pros Properties are sold lower than its market value- You have a chance to find a property without any issues that's being sold for much less than it is worth. It can be a good investment for real estate investors- If your intent is to buy and sell property, the appreciating feature of real estate means you can get bigger returns on the property when you sell it for its actual value. Cons It's sold as is, where is- Finding a good property without issues can be a game of luck when browsing through Pag-IBIG acquired assets. Some foreclosed homes may have been left to deteriorate, so while you might think you're getting a good deal on a home, the money you saved from buying lower than the market value will go towards repairs and renovations. Your options are limited- Your property options are only limited to the available Pag-IBIG acquired assets, so you can't necessarily choose exactly where you want to live. Also, take note that others are also searching for acquired assets, so someone may outbid you or buy the property before you do. Taking steps to ensure that you are making a sound investment (e.g. viewing the property before buying, having a professional assess the home) can help you get your money's worth and not spend excessive amounts repairing the property. If you're interested in learning the process of acquiring foreclosed properties from Pag-IBIG, check out this Pag-IBIG Fund page. Should I invest in Pag-IBIG acquired assets? Ultimately, your decision should be based on whether or not the advantages outweigh the cons and risks of buying an acquired home. But take note that just because houses are auctioned or sold at a discount does not necessarily make it affordable enough to buy the property with out-of-pocket cash. You may still need to apply for a home loan, though for a much lower sum. Finding a good acquired asset to invest in combined with getting a home loan from the bank makes it easier to acquire your first home and pay off your loan in several years. There are many financial advantages to purchasing a Pag-IBIG acquired asset, but you have to recognize the risks that come with buying foreclosed properties. By doing so, you can avoid making a bad purchase and be more likely to find an affordable home you can call your own. If you'd like to purchase your own Pag-IBIG-acquired home but need the extra financial assistance, allow Metrobank to assist you in obtaining your dream home.

        "Body": "If you've been researching \"property investing\" or \"buying a home\" or \"property for your family\", you might have stumbled on Foreclosed Properties and wondered what it is. Properties are considered foreclosed property when a lender, like banks or Pag-Ibig, get the property from the property owner (borrower) who fails to pay their amortizations or defaulted their mortgages. When you loan property or borrow money from the bank or Pag-ibig to purchase a property, the owner of the property is technically the bank (or Pag-ibig). You as the purchaser is a borrower. The only time, you can claim it yours is when you already fully paid the borrowed money. Thus, the bank (or Pag-ibig) will sell the foreclosed home for slightly less than it might be worth to get their investment back. foreclosed property Is it true that foreclosed properties are cheaper? Foreclosed properties is sold below the market value because the bank is motivated to get the property sold and would negotiate more than a seller would. If you happen to find a foreclosed property in a subdivision, you can be sure that the foreclosed property is cheaper than the newly built unit or ready to occupy unit in the subdivision. Why is a foreclosed property cheaper? The seller of the property is the lender: bank or Pag-Ibig. These lenders are selling the property to get their investments back. They are not after the profit but more of the sale or disposal of the property. And since the property has been used, the conditions are not at par with the newly constructed units or homes. These can not be sold at the same price as those newly built ones. The more run down the property is, the more likely it is sold for less. foreclosed property search How do I find foreclosed properties in the area or city I want? The Banks or Pag-ibig usually post their foreclosed property listings available online on their websites. Just to be sure, you can visit the bank or Pag-Ibig and check their foreclosed property listings. You can also find Foreclosure Properties in the Philippines is real estate listings like Filipino Homes. Who owns the foreclosed property? Once the property is foreclosed, the bank or Pag-Ibig is the absolute owner of the property. In some cases, previous owners still live in the foreclosed property. They will be notified to peacefully vacate and remove their belongings in the property within a grace period. It is highly recommended before you purchase a foreclosed property, that you check if the previous owners are still there. Preferably, choose the properties that are not being used by the previous owners anymore. Why should I consider foreclosed property in my next property investment move? The more run-down the property is, the cheaper it is sold in the market. Most people who have the intention to buy the property as an investment is to buy a run-down foreclosed property. They do this so they can buy it for less and reconstruct or renovate the property after buying it. Renovating the property will give you an increase in the property value. Then you can have it rented or sold for a higher price or their current market value. Definitely higher than what you bought it for.",

        "Title": "5 Simple Guidelines In Purchasing A Foreclosed House",
        "Body": "Foreclosed house. What is it? For starters, it is a property taken back by the lender from the previous owner who was not able to pay the price. It has other terms such as real estate owned (REO) property and bank-owned property. It may sound like a second-hand house, but be careful. If you are just getting to know the twists and turns on foreclosed houses, it may not be ideal to purchase that kind of house. It is not going to be easy. You may be fascinated with the prices, but you will definitely go through a number of deals before you get the house that you REALLY want. Sometimes, you will just be surprised with the needed repairs foreclosure But, if you have the confidence of buying a foreclosed house, then you should know certain points before you take out your money for that property. Be cautious about the previous owners Sometimes, it is hard for them to let go of once was theirs. In some cases, the previous owners still manage to stay inside the house even when the auction has already taken place. When this happens to you, you will have to be patient in getting them out from the house. One of the worst things that can possibly happen? The previous owners would do a major mess, leaving you the responsibility of fixing whatever is needed to be fixed. Go bank shopping A foreclosed house can also be a property that is owned by a bank. This is an easier and less hassle way of looking for houses. You do not have to let anyone out. You also have the opportunity of inspecting the house for damages that might need financing repairs. You just have to find a broker who has connections with banks owning foreclosed houses. There are instances when banks hire brokers to put the foreclosed properties in the market. A bank and a real estate broker? They sound safe and assuring. Getting a pre-approval from the lender This process assures the lender that you are capable of paying the price of the house. What the lender does is to contact your employer, bank, or anyone who is credible enough to know the details of your income, credit, and debt history, if there is any. You will, then, be given a letter that contains the lender's approval for the commitment you set to pay for the amount within the arranged time. This is playing safe for the lender's sake. If you want it, make sure that you do your obligation of paying the price. No surprises for very low appraisal rates Most of the time, foreclosed houses are those that are already neglected. Once you go through those houses, don't be surprised to know that there are no more sources of electricity and water. There is an overgrown backyard, and there are personal properties that are placed over the house. Sometimes, walls have become dirty because of vandals written all over them. Because of these instances, the value of the house can go lower than you expect. An extra budget for the maintenance and repair Before you get too excited, make sure you have set aside a considerable amount of money for the repairs and maintenance of the house. Remember, foreclosed houses are sold in the market WITHOUT ANY RENOVATIONS being done. So, you have to assume that REOs are not in any good condition at all. Banks purposely give lower prices to those properties to let the buyers shoulder the fixing of the damages. If there is way to put the price lower, you can do so. But the banks have already lost so much in their part, so your options are only limited. Food for thought... Investing on a house is a decision that must be thoroughly thought through. It should not be taken lightly to the point of just buying whatever is cheaper or enough for the budget. Foreclosed houses are not a bad idea. However, once you have made the final decision of buying one, you know you will need to work harder to get everything fixed.. It's going to be fortunate if you got a good-conditioned house, but it's going to be harder to look for one. Last tip? Don't be in a hurry in owning a house. Just choose carefully. Make everything worth it.",

        "Body": "Are you interested in buying a Pag-IBIG-acquired asset this 2023? Pag-IBIG acquired assets are ideal for low-income earners wanting to own an affordable home and real estate investors wanting to maximize their returns. Here's everything you need to know about how to buy foreclosed properties in Pag-IBIG, so you can make an informed buying decision. What is a Pag-IBIG Acquired Asset? A Pag-IBIG-acquired asset is a property that's been foreclosed because the original owner, who availed of a Pag-IBIG housing loan, failed to pay their monthly amortizations. The Pag-IBIG Fund typically allows delinquent borrowers to buy back their foreclosed property when they default on their payments. It also offers this buy-back option to tenants who occupy and rent the foreclosed properties. If the buy-back option doesn't work out, Pag-IBIG offers the foreclosed property to new buyers at a lower price via public bidding to recover the unpaid loan and generate income for the Fund. If the sale via auction fails for a particular property, it's then put up for Pag-IBIG negotiated sale in which buyers can get as much as a 30% discount. Yes. Purchasing a foreclosed property from Pag-IBIG makes financial sense for two reasons. First, Pag-IBIG-acquired assets are sold at prices below the market value. It enables you to afford a home if you don't have enough money to purchase a brand-new property. You'll have lower monthly amortizations if you avail of a Pag-IBIG housing loan to finance a foreclosed property. Second, Pag-IBIG foreclosed properties are an excellent investment. Buying one allows you to buy low and sell or rent high. Not to mention that the value of real estate increases over time. However, there are risks to buying a foreclosed home. These are sold on an \"as is, where is\" basis, meaning some may have damaged parts. If a foreclosed property's condition is less than ideal, you'll have to spend money to fix it.

Verify the provided information on the property, such as its lot and floor area. Assess the property's environment (i.e., Is it a safe and peaceful community? Is it prone to flooding?) and accessibility to public transport, malls, schools, hospitals, etc. You may visit the property with an engineer or real estate expert to help you evaluate the property and identify the necessary repairs and improvements. Proceed with the bidding or reservation of the property only when you're sure it meets your requirements.  Be Personally Present During the Reservation The Pag-IBIG Fund requires the buyer's appearance when reserving an acquired asset. Buyer's appearance is still required for reservations under real estate agents or brokers. Pag-IBIG accepts the Special Power of Attorney only if the principal buyer is an OFW currently abroad.  Transact with Pag-IBIG Employees Only Beware of fixers and fake agents or employees of the Pag-IBIG Fund. Make your payments only in the Pag-IBIG office. Even agents and brokers are prohibited from collecting or accepting payments for the purchase.  Avoid Occupied Properties The Pag-IBIG Acquired Assets page specifies which foreclosed properties are occupied or vacant. Buying or bidding on an occupied property can cause trouble later if the occupants refuse to vacate it.

        "Title": "How to Buy a Condo in the Philippines: Requirements, Process, and Tips",
        "Body": "Condominiums in the Philippines are a popular choice among home seekers. While some people are drawn to the amenities and general convenience that condo living offers, others find getting a condo more of a need than a luxury. Regardless of your personal situation, buying a condo is an important milestone. A condo is a big purchase, so don't go in blindly and commit to it without a plan. Whether you're a millennial looking forward to living independently, a newlywed planning to start a family, or an expat or foreigner ready to retire in the Philippines, doing your due diligence as a responsible homebuyer will pay you dividends down the line. If you're interested in buying a condo in the Philippines, you've come to the right place. We've put together this guide to help you. ### Buying a Condo in the Philippines? Weigh the Pros and Cons First Owning a condo has its ups and downs, so don't fixate only on the positives. You should weigh the pros and cons of buying a condo in the Philippines because, as attractive as a condo is on the surface, it's not really designed for everyone. Who are condos for in the first place? If you're subscribed to the whole condo vs. house debate, you may already know that some people prefer getting a condo over a house because the former is more affordable in the short term, all other factors considered. But is that enough reason to buy a condo? Is the timing even right, with the real estate industry still in a bit of a slump after the pandemic? The answers to those questions may vary depending on who you ask. However, according to investment management company Colliers, while prices in the Philippine condo market are still below pre-pandemic levels, the outlook is generally positive. In fact, numbers are expected to get back to normal in 2023. Real estate in the Philippines, specifically in the secondary market, is on the upswing--thanks in part to local professionals and expatriates breathing new life into it. With the condo market showing signs of stabilization and growth, investing in it doesn't sound like a bad idea. If, after studying the current market landscape and assessing your own needs and capabilities, you decide that owning a condo in the Philippines is for you, then read on. ### 5 Steps to Buying a Condo in the Philippines Ready to buy your own real estate property? Make sure not to rush it--equip yourself with enough knowledge to embrace not just the benefits but also the risks of making this purchase. Here's how to buy a condo in the Philippines to help you make sound decisions. #### Step 1: Evaluate What You Can Responsibly Afford When making a purchase as big as a condo, your finances should be the first thing you sort out. As much as it's good to believe in the promise of affordable resort-style living, attaining it is not as easy as it appears, especially if you don't already have the means to start and sustain that kind of lifestyle. A condominium is by default an expense, not an investment. It becomes an investment only when you rent it out and eventually regain the money you spent. Until then, treat it as a cost that will set you back significantly if you commit to it hastily without the right resources. The last thing you want is to make a bad call and end up drowning in debt. Right from the get-go, you have to be certain that you can cover the costs of buying and owning a condo. How much to buy a condo in the Philippines depends on other factors like the size of the property you're getting and its location. **Condo Prices Per City in the Philippines** According to online statistics authority Statista, the average condo price per square meter in the Philippines, specifically in Metro Manila, is P225,290. This is as of the second quarter of 2022. Of course, that price varies per city. Some places are naturally more expensive to live in than others. Take Ayala Center in Makati and Bonifacio Global City (BGC) in Taguig, for example. These areas are central business districts, so expect higher costs of living with higher condo prices. Meanwhile, cities on the outskirts of Metro Manila, like Caloocan or Las Pinas, have relatively lower condo prices. If you go to the capital city, you'll find that the lowest condo price in Manila is still quite expensive at a few million pesos. You'll be hard-pressed to find anything below P2 million in the current market. If you do, make sure to research thoroughly about the developer and property before signing up. **Condo Prices Per Property Size** The average condo price in the Philippines also varies depending on property size. According to Global Property Guide, an international real estate information authority, the average price of studio units in major Metro Manila cities is P4,062,249.68. For three-bedroom units, it's more than quadruple of that at P16,856,796.58. In Cebu, studio units cost around P3,149,487, with one-to-three-bedroom units ranging from P5,675,048.28 to P19,144,287.36. These are all based on 2022 figures. To get a ballpark price of the unit you're eyeing, either check the property developer's website or request a quotation from an accredited real estate agent. **Down Payment and Amortization** Now that you have a rough idea of how much condos cost in the Philippines, you can start assessing your own paying capacity and make a plan. If you're an average condo buyer, it's likely you won't be able to pay for the condo in full right from the get-go. You'll have to prepare a big sum for your condo down payment in the Philippines. To gauge if you can afford to buy a condo, compare your income against the total value of the property you're looking at. If you can pay for 30% to 40% of it outright while still being relatively comfortable, you're all good. If 40% is too much, you should be able to shell out at least 20% to 30% to minimize your monthly amortization. Not being able to pay even 20% for a lump sum down payment is a sign that you might have to abandon the idea of getting that condo--it's likely you can't afford it at all! Look for an alternative that fits your budget better. Apart from the down payment, you also need to think about your monthly amortization. Remember that the first computation presented to you is likely just an estimate based on current interest rates. It's still subject to future repricing--and depending on the market's performance, the result of that repricing may be either higher or lower interest rates. **Other Condo Fees and Costs to Consider** Apart from the down payment and monthly amortization, you also have to pay other expenses, including the condo association dues, homeowners' association (HOA) fees, fire insurance, condo utilities, security fees, and closing fees like documentary stamp tax, transfer fees, and registration fees. On top of these, you should also consider the real property taxes that you should pay when buying a condo in the Philippines. #### Step 2: Be Clear About Your Idea of a Perfect Location Once you know your budget, consider another important factor when buying a condo in the Philippines: location. It can make or break your whole condo living experience, so it's something you can't compromise on. A condo in a less-than-ideal location defeats its own purpose, as people buy condos for the sake of convenience. If convenience is largely defined by location, then in order to find the right condo, you have to first define your \"perfect location.\" Remember, the best place to buy a condo in the Philippines is the place that works best for you--and it's only you who can identify that. Here are some things to consider in terms of your ideal location when buying a condo in the Philippines: - Is it near your place of work? - Is it close to key establishments like hospitals and schools? - Is there any cosmopolitan district with access to food and lifestyle hubs? - Is there any economically secure area with a high rent appreciation? - Does it offer a safe environment to protect you and your loved ones from harm? - Is it a whole built-in condo community that provides everything you need within arm's reach? - Is there any peaceful spot that takes you away from the noise and congestion of the city? - Or do you have a preference for any particular city or province? Maybe you've been to some of the best places to live in the Philippines and made up your mind about settling down in one of them. Once you've identified your perfect location, narrow down your search to condos in that area. Just make sure to keep your budget in mind because, as mentioned, condo prices in the Philippines vary per location. Try to be flexible if you're operating on a tighter budget. If possible, you can also wait until you have a bigger budget for a better location. #### Step 3: Find a Highly Reputed Developer One of the most crucial things to consider when buying a condo in the Philippines is the developer. There are always new condos for sale everywhere, but there's no need for you to look at all of them. Optimize your search and narrow your choices down to the best options within your ideal price range by checking out properties only from the most trusted developers. **How to Choose a Developer in the Philippines** While some good real estate developers in the Philippines occasionally have a few bad properties, you have a higher likelihood of finding a good property by starting with a good developer. But where do you even begin? There are many routes you can take, including the following: - Do a quick background check about the developer online. - Join social media groups and pages dedicated to sharing insights about the developer. - Ask users of online forums or discussion websites for any relevant input. - Interview actual condo owners when you visit a property. Here's a list of what to ask when buying a condo in the Philippines--these questions are mostly about developers: - Does the developer generally have a good track record? - How long has the developer been in the industry? - What innovations are the developer known for? - What awards and accolades has the developer received? - What are the amenities that the developer often includes in its properties? - Is the management competent? - How does the developer maintain its properties? - What are after-sales services like? - Who are the developer's target audiences? - What's the reputation of the neighborhoods created by the developer? - Who are the developer's partner establishments? - How does the developer treat its business tenants? - Are there any big names tied to the developer? What is their reputation? - How has the developer addressed issues or controversies in the past? #### Step 4: Research the Property Diligently As any condo buying guide in the Philippines will tell you, it's not enough to find a good condo location and developer--you also have to check the actual property. Do an ocular visit and research in-depth about the property beforehand. Conducting an on-site inspection and thorough walk-through of the property will save you from unpleasant surprises when you move in. Do your due diligence before making a purchase. While there are many condominiums for sale in the Philippines, a huge chunk of them are not really worth your time. The perks they promise may appear to hold up at first but fall apart under scrutiny. Don't be enticed by shiny advertising--zoom in on the details and take a closer look at what each property is actually worth. #### Step 5: Prepare All the Required Documents The process of buying a house in the Philippines is not exactly the same as that of buying a condo, but they do have something in common: the extensive documentation involved. Buying real estate is a big deal, so you can't expect it to be as simple as buying a random trinket in the mall. To give you a snapshot of what you'll have to prepare, here are some of the basic requirements for buying a condo in the Philippines: - Proof of identity (i.e., valid government ID with photo) - Proof of income (i.e., employment certificates, bank statements, etc.) - Reservation agreement There are also documents you must secure to prove your ownership of the property and protect yourself from legal disputes and claims down the line: - Contract to sell - Deed of absolute sale - Transfer certificate of title - Tax declarations - Payment receipts If there's any document whose purpose you don't understand, don't hesitate to reach out to a real estate or legal professional. It's better to ask questions now than suffer the consequences of misinformation or ignorance later on. --- **Bonus Tip on Buying a Condo in the Philippines: Prepare to Adjust Your Lifestyle** We can't stress this enough--buying a condo is a big move. It requires commitment, mental fortitude, and even a major lifestyle change if you're not already living like a condo dweller. Just think about it--condo living is a lifestyle. Your new space will likely be smaller than what you're used to, so you have to explore being a minimalist. You can no longer buy any piece of junk you see--you have to be conscious of everything you own. Living in a smaller space also means you have to be tidier, so you can maximize every square meter of your unit. Buying a condo ties you to a certain location, which limits your mobility. If you plan on moving out in the next few years or so, you won't be able to maximize the full use of your condo--which would be a shame, especially if you paid a fortune for it. If you have plans to migrate abroad, you might have to reassess either that or your plans to buy a condo. Moreover, you have to consider the potential impact that a condo purchase might have on your peace of mind. If you bite more than you can chew and push through with this big purchase without first covering all your bases, you might as well say goodbye to your sanity for the next few years. One of the worst-case scenarios that await you as an irresponsible real estate buyer is defaulting on your condo payments and seeing all your hard-earned money go down the drain. So make sure you're absolutely prepared before making such a big commitment. --- **Final Thoughts** A manual that fully captures how to buy or own a condo in the Philippines doesn't exist. There are lessons you'll learn only through experience. Still, it's wise to absorb as much knowledge as you can before signing any contract, so make sure to exhaust all the resources available to you. Don't make any final decisions regarding buying a condo in the Philippines until you're absolutely sure that you can stand by them. Good luck with your condo hunting and buying journey! Sources: 1.

        "Title": "When to Build a House: Why Now is the Best Time to Construct a Home",
        "Body": "So you've finally decided to move out of your parents' place and build your own--congratulations! You are taking a crucial step toward independence and will learn a lot along the way. If you're adamant about building your very own dream home from scratch rather than just buying one, know that it can get more expensive, time-consuming, and stressful. Then again, who doesn't want to make their very own dream home materialize? But before you start thinking about hiring an architect and a contractor, there are plenty of things to consider--such as the best month to build a house in the Philippines in 2023. ### Is 2023 a Good Year to Buy a House? It's been barely a couple of years after the height of the pandemic, with inflation currently on the rise. You'd think that now wouldn't be a good time to buy or build a house. Young homeowners, however, think differently. Due to the stay-at-home mandates in recent years, millennials and Gen Zs realized the value of becoming independent and getting their own space. Plus, the future of the real estate market looks bright, particularly this 2023. The Philippine economy expanded by 7.6% last year, and the residential market is expected to mirror its growth. Prospective homeowners can look forward to a new supply of around 3,540 residential units in Metro Manila this year. Besides, with online loan application processes, it's easier than ever to get a home loan. And with plenty of housing loan providers to choose from, you can start building your property right away. Additionally, keep in mind that the value of real estate typically appreciates over time. So invest in it as soon as you can. ### What is the Best Month to Build a House in the Philippines in 2023? Now that you know that this year is a good time to build a house, what about the best month to start building a house in the Philippines in 2023? If you're into feng shui, lucky months to build a house in 2023 reportedly include August, September, and October. But this is where it gets tricky--August is typically Ghost Month, during which it's inadvisable to start construction for fear of offending spirits. On the other hand, if you're looking for more pragmatic tips, consider these: #### Avoid the Rainy Season as Much as You Can Consider the climate in the Philippines. Avoid starting construction during the rainy months of June to November. A delayed construction would be the least of your worries--strong winds can knock down equipment, floods can cause structural damage, and torrential downpours can damage materials and reduce workers' visibility, leading to accidents. If construction does end up going well into the rainy season, your contractor should enforce relevant safety protocols at the work site. #### Consider That It Can Get Too Hot During Summer With that, your knee-jerk reaction might be to consider summer instead. So are March, April, and May good months to build a house? Well, yes--you won't have to worry about adverse weather and other natural disasters damaging the materials and concrete. However, summer in the Philippines can get too hot to handle. Machinery and equipment, when used under the sun's sweltering glare, can overheat and malfunction. Meanwhile, workers are subject to irritability, dizziness, decreased concentration, and even increased heart rate or heat stroke. These compromise not just their health and safety, but that of others on site. What, then, is the best month to construct a house? If we're talking about the weather, the best months to build a house in the Philippines in 2023 are from December to February, when the weather is moderately cool and the skies are clear for the most part. #### Monitor the Prices of Construction Materials Aside from the weather, however, you should also consider the state of the construction material retail market. Currently, prices seem to be on a downward trajectory. Per data from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), prices dropped from 5.5% to 5.4% in February 2023. For the past seven months, prices of retail materials have been steadily easing. Now might be the perfect time to take advantage of that. ### Fund Your House Construction with a Security Bank Home Loan Taking the weather and current prices of materials into account, now is the best month to build a house in the Philippines in 2023. If you're looking for funding options, consider the Security Bank Home Loan. You can easily apply for it, get approved, and start construction ASAP! With this home construction loan from Security Bank, you can borrow up to 80% of the property's appraised value. Check out its features: - Flexible loan terms: Up to 15 years for a residential vacant lot, 20 years for a townhouse or duplex, and 25 years for a house and lot - Low interest rates: Fixed rates of 7% for one year, 7.25% for three years, and 7.75% for five years - High loan amount: Ranging from P1 million up to P10 million - All-in Financing: An option to include bank fees as part of your loanable amount instead of paying them upfront Interested? Start your Security Bank Home Loan application online. But first, make sure you meet the eligibility requirements: - 21 to 65 years old upon loan maturity - With a minimum monthly income of P50,000 (combined amount for joint borrowers) - Employed for at least two years - If self-employed, must be operating a legitimate and profitable business for the last three years Check out the list of requirements on Security Bank's website. ### Final Thoughts There are a lot of things to take into account when choosing the best month to build a house in the Philippines in 2023. But perhaps the most important consideration of all is how prepared you are. Don't rush into construction if you aren't ready yet. Make sure you know what you want in a house. Learn how the construction process works. Lastly, get your finances in order. --- **Sources:** 1. Real estate's prospects and opportunities in 2023 (BusinessWorld, 2023) 2.

        "Title": "Downsizing? Here are Tiny House Design Ideas in the Philippines",
        "Body": "Tiny houses are gaining traction abroad because of the affordability they offer to homeowners. Filipinos are also starting to see the appeal and recognize the benefits of living in a small, stylish, and functional space. ### What is Considered a Tiny House? A tiny house in the Philippines usually has a floor area of 18 to 54 square meters (sqm). However, there's no one size for a tiny house because it depends on the homeowner's design. For example, if you build a tiny house out of a shipping container, which usually measures 6m x 2m or 12m x 2m, your tiny house will have 14 sqm or 29 sqm of living space. ### How Much Does a Tiny House Cost? Got a design for a small house in the Philippines? Construction can cost anywhere from P150,000 to P2 million. Of course, it still depends on the tiny house's size, its inclusions, and the materials to be used. For example, if you use a six-meter shipping container, you can spend around P800,000 for three containers to make 55 sqm of living space. If you hire a contractor, expect to spend around P17,000 to P25,000 per square meter. ### The Pros of a Tiny House Living in a tiny house doesn't mean living in squalor. Many people live in small homes to embrace a simple and minimalist life. And in case you don't know it yet, living in a small house in the Philippines has plenty of benefits. Here are some of them: **It Costs Less** Save money by building and living in a smaller house. Regular houses typically cost over a million pesos, but you can build a tiny house for a fraction of that cost. Since you won't have to shell out a large amount of money, you can enjoy more breathing room in your monthly budget. Moreover, you enjoy lower overhead expenses. With less space to clean, organize, and decorate, you save more money on cleaning products, furniture, and appliances. Use this money for other essential expenses or occasional luxuries. **It's Low-Maintenance** Tiny houses are low-maintenance. The upkeep won't be tiring, time-consuming, or costly. And because you won't have to spend the whole day cleaning the entire house, you have more time to do things you love. **It's a More Sustainable Way to Live** Compared to a traditional house, tiny houses require fewer materials and less energy to power and cool. According to a study conducted by Maria Saxton, a Ph.D. candidate in environmental planning and design at Virginia Tech in the U.S., people who downsized to tiny homes reduced their energy consumption, on average, by 45%. **You Enjoy a Different Kind of Freedom** A tiny house is customizable. You have the freedom to redecorate, add rooms, change the windows, or repaint the walls anytime. Unlike in a condo, you can build a tiny deck or veranda, a pocket garden, or even a little playground for your kids or pets. You can add a second floor (or even a third) as your needs change over time. After you purchase a lot to build your tiny house on, the property is entirely yours. You have the full and exclusive right to it. Plus, it's an excellent long-term investment. Even if the tiny house's structure declines over the years, the value of the land it's built on appreciates. ### The Cons of a Tiny House Let's face it--tiny houses aren't for everyone. They don't work for all homeowners for various reasons, such as these: **There's Too Little Space** The most obvious con is the small living and storage space. Prepare to give up space or even your privacy if you're living with your family. To maximize your space capacity, you'll have to minimize the kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom spaces. You'll need to buy small appliances and multi-functional furniture and dispose of things that won't fit in your tiny space. You might even have to skip hosting dinner parties, slumber parties, or weekend hangouts because of your limited space. **You Need to Clean More Frequently** You may have a smaller space to clean, but you'll have to tidy up more often than usual. A little mess in a tidy home is more noticeable and distracting. It can instantly make the house look cluttered or disorganized. **It Can Be Challenging to Find Tiny House Builders or Designers** Because the tiny house movement in the Philippines is relatively new, there aren't a lot of builders with extensive experience, especially if you have a unique house design or structure in mind. ### Tiny House Design Ideas in the Philippines When it comes to tiny house design ideas in the Philippines, there's no universal size, shape, or layout. Tiny houses can be made from shipping containers or look like smaller versions of luxurious mansions or traditional homes. **Prefabricated House** A modular or prefabricated house in the Philippines is a pre-built home. The essential components of the house are built in the factory or on-site. The parts are then shipped to the site, where they're assembled. Since it's pre-built, external factors like rain and wind are not a problem. It's also more efficient, with fewer delays--you can build a modular house in the Philippines in just a few hours. **Shipping Container Homes** Shipping containers are built with the strongest steel that can withstand extreme weather. If you want a bright and airy container home, you can easily customize it with large windows on all sides. They're also easily accessible. You can find several companies that sell and deliver them to your location, which is why prefabricated container houses in the Philippines are popular tiny house options. If you have a smaller budget, you can reuse old shipping containers to build a tiny house. This family reused container homes to make their 55-sqm tiny home, which cost around P800,000 to build. ### Considerations Before Building Your Tiny House A modern tiny house in the Philippines is an excellent alternative for people who want their own homes without spending millions. Here are some things to consider before you start building yours: - **Get a feel of tiny living.** Do a test run to know if tiny living is for you. Experience living in a small space and leading a minimalist lifestyle. Try decluttering and holding on to essentials only. - **Research.** Through articles and YouTube videos, learn about other people's experiences building and living in their tiny houses. Take note of how they set a budget, save on costs, and pick out designs to maximize the space. - **Buy the real estate for it.** You need to purchase the lot where you'll build your tiny house. Developers recommend moving away from the metro and building one in the suburbs or rural areas. - **Decide on your essential spaces.** Do you need a bigger kitchen or a more spacious sleeping area?

        "Body": "Buying property? Keep the real estate agents' mantra \"location, location, and location\" in mind. When making home purchase decisions, investors need to understand the value of location. Properties with direct access to essential amenities and facilities--such as schools, workplaces, hospitals, churches, and transport terminals--provide convenience. This is why a lot of us are drawn to big cities and metropolitan areas. The struggle, however, is that prime properties are expensive. These days, property developers are creating communities outside of Manila. You have the chance to find properties that aren't that expensive yet. Moreover, in the long run, major cities will be decongested and provincial cities and towns will be put in the spotlight. If you're looking for the best place to live in the Philippines, here are some recommendations to consider. ### Best Place to Live in the Philippines in 2023: 13 Options to Consider For a country as big as the Philippines, you won't run out of options. Get a sneak peek of the country's best and most ideal places to live in, starting with Luzon. #### Best Places to Live in Luzon **Baguio** Baguio has a lot of things going for it. Who doesn't love the cool weather and iconic tourist spots, such as Burnham Park, Tam-awan Village, and Bencab Museum? Tourism is Baguio's lifeblood, followed by agriculture and hospitality. If you're looking to settle down in Baguio, you'll be glad to know that it's reportedly one of the safest cities in the Philippines. Plus, the cost of living is relatively lower compared to other major cities in the country. For those with kids, Baguio is home to some of the best schools in the country, such as Saint Louis University, University of the Philippines Baguio, University of the Cordilleras, and more. **Bulacan** Because of its proximity to Manila, Bulacan is one of the best places to live in Luzon. You can take that much-needed breather but still easily head back to Manila whenever you need to. Transportation shouldn't be a problem, as the province has direct access to the North Luzon Expressway (NLEX). It can also be accessed through the Subic-Clark-Tarlac Expressway (SCTEX). It takes only about an hour and a half to get to Bulacan from Manila, making it ideal for those who want to live near the city but avoid traffic. If you're a commuter, you can anticipate the opening of the MRT Line 7, which will take you from Bulacan to Manila in just around 30 minutes. And if you're a frequent flyer, the New Manila International Airport is an exciting development to watch out for. Malls and enterprises are already established--you'll never get bored! Numerous malls allow individuals to enjoy both rural and urban life. Major real estate developers, such as Ayala Land, are building townships in San Jose del Monte City. You may also consider Ayala Land's Altaraza (which features Avida Settings Altaraza). Looking for the best subdivision in Bulacan? Take your pick between Camella Bulacan, Avida Parkfield Settings Pulilan, and others. Megaworld is set to develop the 85-hectare Northwind Global City in Marilao and Bocaue, transforming the city into a global business district in 15 to 20 years. **Pampanga** Another province up north that can be considered among the best places to live in the Philippines is Pampanga. It gives easy access to the Clark International Airport, North Luzon Expressway (NLEX), and Subic-Clark-Tarlac Expressway (SCTEX). You can also enjoy the benefits of infrastructure projects, such as the North-South Commuter Railway (NSCR), which is expected to be completed by 2023. Leading cities and towns include Angeles, San Fernando, and Porac. Some of the best subdivisions in Pampanga include Megaworld's Capital Town in San Fernando, Ayala Land's Alviera in Porac, Filinvest's Claremont in Mabalacat, and Century Properties' The Resort Residences in San Fernando. **Laguna** For many real estate investors, Laguna will always be a foolproof choice. Foremost, a huge portion of the South Luzon Expressway (SLEX) is covered by the province. Second, it offers a sophisticated mix of urban and rural living. It also serves as a gateway to holiday destinations such as Tagaytay and Batangas. Laguna houses a number of major manufacturing plants and businesses. Take Santa Rosa City, for example, which is nicknamed the Detroit of the Philippines due to the number of car manufacturer factories in the city. If you're raising kids, you can choose between reputable schools, such as the University of the Philippines (UP) Los Banos, Malayan Colleges (Mapua), University of Perpetual-Help Laguna, Miriam College, De La Salle University, Colegio San Agustin, and Brent International School. Top developments and projects include Ayala Land's Nuvali, Eton Properties' Eton City, and Megaworld's Southwoods City. **Tagaytay** Because of its cool climate, Tagaytay also makes it to this list of the best places to live in the Philippines. The city is located on a ridge overlooking the Taal Volcano, making it the perfect spot to enjoy nature and breathtaking sights. Moreover, Tagaytay has numerous tourist attractions, such as the Taal Vista Hotel, People's Park in the Sky, and Tagaytay Ridge. The city is accessible via the Tagaytay-Nasugbu Highway and the Tagaytay-Calamba Road. You can also use the Skyway and the newly opened CALAX for a smoother, faster drive up north. It will take you less than two hours to get to Bulacan and an hour and a half to NAIA Terminal 3. If you want to live in Tagaytay, check out the following communities: Ayala Land's Serin East and West, Vista Land's Camella Silang, and Megaworld's Twin Lakes. **Batangas** Because it's blessed with natural resources, Batangas is also one of the best places to live in Luzon. The province has an abundance of beaches, mountains, and lakes. Business in the province has grown over the years, making it a perfect choice for people who are looking for work and business opportunities. Batangas also has thriving industries such as fisheries, agriculture, and tourism. Batangas is accessible through the STAR Tollway and SLEX. Travel time from Batangas to Makati takes about 1.5 hours by car, depending on the traffic situation and other external factors. Batangas is not too urbanized but not too rural--perfect for people who want to steer away from Metro Manila's busy and fast-paced environment. It's also an excellent option for starting families since children can enjoy nature and outdoor activities. If you want to settle in Batangas, feel free to check Rockwell Land Corporation's Terreno South, AboitizLand Seafront Residences, and Suntrust's Sienna Hills. **Cavite** If you're on the lookout for a reasonably priced real estate package in a location poised for growth, consider Cavite as one of the best places to live in the Philippines. It has access to three major expressways: the Cavite-Laguna Expressway or CALAX (that connects you to SLEX), the Muntinlupa-Cavite Expressway or MCX (also connects you to SLEX), and the Manila-Cavite Expressway (CAVITEX). The province is home to leading business process outsourcing (BPO) companies, such as TaskUs, Inc. and IQOR Philippines. Top universities and colleges, such as De La Salle-Dasmarinas, Emilio Aguinaldo College, and San Sebastian College, are also in Cavite. If you're looking for the best place to live in Cavite, check out the following communities: Ayala Land's Vermosa, PRO-FRIENDS' Lancaster New City, Vista Land's The Island Park, Cathay Land's South Forbes City, and Megaworld's Southwoods City (Cavite part). **Antipolo** What makes Antipolo one of the best places to live in Luzon? Its proximity to Manila and its calming, rural feel. This city in Rizal is accessible via Marcos Highway and Sumulong Highway. Antipolo is also home to schools such as De La Salle-College of Saint Benilde, Our Lady of Fatima University, and ICCT Colleges. The city is known for its many religious sites and tourist spots, such as the Our Lady of Peace and Good Voyage Shrine, Hinulugang Taktak, and the Pinto Art Museum. If you're looking for the best place to build a house in the Philippines, consider Antipolo. The city has numerous subdivisions and villages that offer affordable townhouses and condominium units. Check out Megaworld's Eastland Heights, Camella Homes Eastridge, and Fernandez/Martinez-Leyba, Inc.'s Fairmount Hills, which is considered the Forbes Park of Antipolo. #### Best Places to Live in Visayas The best place to live in the Philippines may not necessarily be in Luzon, so consider scoping out locations in other regions, too, like major cities in Visayas. **Cebu City** Those who have been to Cebu City for a vacation or business trip will certainly tell you that it's like being in Makati or Taguig. This is primarily because of its bustling environment, dominated by towering skyscrapers, posh restaurants, and massive business parks. However, its rich culture keeps it grounded. Its proximity to holiday destinations, such as Oslob and Bohol, makes it one of the best locations to buy a house in the Philippines. Cebu can be accessed by air, sea, and land. If you're a jet setter who flies internationally, the Mactan-Cebu International Airport is just nearby. In the coming years, Cebu City is expected to transform significantly because of the multi-billion projects planned for the region. These include Isla Dela Victoria, Seaside Arena, Cebu-Cordova Link Expressway (CCLEX), Metro Cebu Expressway, and Ming-Mori Business Park in Minglanilla. Cebu City is also a haven of quality education since the UP Cebu, University of Cebu, Cebu Institute of Technology, University of San Jose-Recoletos, and the University of San Carlos are all located here. **Iloilo City** This coastal city on Panay Island has many beautiful things in store--not just for tourists, but also for people looking to settle down and real estate investors who want profitable properties. Iloilo City is one of the best places to live in the Philippines, especially if you want to integrate historical sensibilities into urban living. Major architectural themes lean towards Spanish aesthetics, and a lot of districts still have plazas. Iloilo City has always been a premier center of trade, commerce, finance, health, and tourism in the Western Visayas region. The Iloilo International Airport is also a major gateway to important Asian cities here and abroad. The city has a wealth of reputable colleges and universities, such as the UP Iloilo City Campus, University of Iloilo, University of San Agustin, Saint Paul University, and Western Institute of Technology. Major real estate developments come from Ayala Land (including the Atria Park District), DoubleDragon Properties Corporation (owned by Ilonggo native Injap Sia, the founder of Mang Inasal), and residential projects such as FirstHomes. **Bacolod City** Just like Iloilo, Bacolod is a bustling coastal city. You can access it via land, sea, and air. It has busy seaports, a clear indicator of active trade and a rising economy. Its airport is your doorway to other major cities, such as Manila, Cebu, and Davao. Some visitors may liken Bacolod to Iloilo because of its designs and architectural style. Bacolod is part of the Bacolod Metropolitan Area, which also includes the cities of Talisay and Silay. While the city thrives in agriculture, it is also home to IT and BPO companies. If you want your kids to enjoy high-quality education, Bacolod has excellent universities and colleges, such as Colegio San Agustin, La Consolacion College, the University of Saint La Salle, and Bacolod City College. The City of Smiles has attracted some of the country's major real estate developers, such as Megaworld, the company behind The Upper East, and Ayala Land, which developed Envisions, a fully integrated community patterned after other Ayala townships. #### Best Places to Live in Mindanao Still looking for the best place to live in the Philippines? Don't worry because you might find it in Mindanao. **Cagayan de Oro City** Cagayan de Oro is considered one of the next-wave cities in the country. Real estate think tanks, such as Lamudi, say this North Mindanao city is on the brink of a real estate \"explosion.\" CDO is not just for adventurers who want to experience the thrill of whitewater rafting. It's also one of the best places to buy property in the Philippines, especially now that the city is investing heavily in infrastructure. This includes the expansion of the Laguindingan Airport and the development of the biggest passenger terminal at the city's port. Other than tourism and agriculture, Cagayan de Oro's BPO industry is also expanding. When it comes to education, Cagayan de Oro is proud of its prestigious institutions, such as Xavier University-Ateneo de Cagayan, Liceo de Cagayan University, Capitol University, and the University of Science and Technology of Southern Philippines. **Davao City** Like the Visayan cities of Iloilo and Bacolod, Davao is also a coastal city. You can reach it via air and sea. The city also has an extensive bus network that can take you back to Manila and other key cities from Mindanao. Davao is very much like Metro Manila when it comes to economic performance, as it's home to diverse industries. While agriculture remains the city's largest economic sector, it also plays host to leading companies, such as Coca-Cola Bottlers, Phil., RC Cola Philippines, Pepsi-Cola, Phoenix Petroleum, Holcim Philippines, and SteelAsia. Tourism is also a big contributor to the success of the city, as demonstrated by hospitality businesses, such as Marco Polo Davao, Apo View Hotel, and Pearl Farm Beach Resort. Davao City is often hailed as one of the safest and most affordable places to live in the Philippines. It's also home to top universities, such as the Ateneo de Davao University, the University of Mindanao, and the University of Southeastern Philippines. ### Is Real Estate a Good Investment in the Philippines? Every real estate investor in the Philippines always asks this question. After all, investing in a condominium or a house and lot package requires you to shell out a great deal of money. No doubt about it--real estate is a good investment in the Philippines. The country has a temperate climate and excellent infrastructure, making it an ideal place to live. The Build Build Build program has so far completed over 40,000 kilometers of roads, which are linked to several cities and provinces. There are numerous real estate options available in the Philippines, so do your research before investing. The best places to invest are those with a stable economy and offer plenty of growth opportunities. If you can't afford a property now, you don't have to force it. Otherwise, you'll just end up suffering financially or having a hard time choosing between your priorities. ### Where to Invest in Real Estate in the Philippines: 5 Things to Consider **Location** Obviously, this should be at the top of your list, especially now that you know the best places to live in the Philippines. When choosing a location, always consider your long-term plans. Do you plan to live away from Manila's hustle and bustle? Are you planning to build your own resort? Do you want your kids to always wake up to fresh morning air, away from pollution? **Property Cost** Expect properties located in central business districts and key cities to be expensive. Avoid properties and housing loans that are difficult to pay off. Stick to your budget to avoid financial troubles in the end. Remember that the costs of buying the property don't just end with your mortgage. You'll also have to think about construction, home insurance, maintenance, and renovation. **Property Type** Your real estate property should always be in line with your lifestyle and future plans. In case you and your spouse want to have four kids, getting a 24-square-meter condominium may not be the best idea, for instance. **School District** Another thing to consider when buying a property is the school district. If you have a growing family, make sure your home is just a few minutes away from schools and universities. Choose a place that's home to excellent education with plenty of opportunities for extracurricular activities. **Accessibility of Services, Establishments, and Infrastructure** It's also important to consider the accessibility of services before buying property. The best place to live in the Philippines should have excellent infrastructure and plenty of services available, such as hospitals, malls, and restaurants. Consider ongoing and future road developments or infrastructure projects in the vicinity, whether they're developing lands, roads, or business hubs. ### Final Thoughts If you're looking for a place with lots of hospitality and investment opportunities plus accessibility to Metro Manila, find a place in Luzon. But if you're after a more relaxed lifestyle surrounded by natural beauty, then Visayas might be perfect for you. Or if you want to experience all that the Philippines has to offer--from beaches to forests and rice paddies--then Mindanao is definitely worth considering. Of course, real estate is always a gamble. Your journey can get tough, and you'll definitely have a lot of questions in mind. But don't get stressed. Do things one step at a time. First, determine the best places to live in the Philippines. And from there, decide which location is perfect for you. **Sources:** 1. Megaworld to build P98-B global business district in Bulacan 2.

        "Title": "Buying a House for Couples: 10 Tips to Keep in Mind",
        "Body": "Ready for the next chapter of your life? If you're reading this, home-buying is clearly on the horizon for you. It hardly matters if you're newlyweds who recently tied the knot, a couple still planning for the big day, or partners just looking to build a home together. Reaching this milestone is a great feat on its own and should be met with deserved cheers. Congrats on unlocking a new level of adulting! Take a moment to celebrate. But once the festivities die down, plant your feet back on the ground. Remember that owning a home is not as glamorous as it seems. You need a lot of time, money, patience, and--if this is your first big purchase as a couple--courage to get through this in one piece. Lucky for you, we have some tips for buying a house for couples so that you don't have to go house-hunting with a blunt spear. ### 10 House-Hunting Tips for Couples Buying a house isn't as easy as they make it look in lifestyle shows: a couple shows up at an open house, falls in love with the place, and then issues a check before the episode is over. In real life, there are many things to consider before deciding on the perfect house for couples. Here are important home-buying tips in 2023. **Do a Finance Health Check** For first-time home buyers, it's important to evaluate your joint financial situation early on. Take a minute to sit with your partner and lay all your cards on the table. The last thing you want is to sign a binding contract, only to find out later that you married someone deep in debt. That's an awful way to slip into financial quicksand. Do a finance health check with your spouse before making any commitments so you know exactly where you stand. You'll get an idea of what you can and can't afford, setting you up for a more realistic journey ahead. **Start a House Fund** Stash away some extra cash for your home purchase. If you can pay for your house in full without overly limiting your daily spending, all you have to save for are the smaller stuff like furnishings, utilities, fees, taxes, insurance, and other miscellaneous costs. On the other hand, if you need to take out a loan to purchase a house, take note that you still have to save up for a down payment. Typically, that's between 10% and 30% of the total property value. If you're eyeing a house worth millions, make sure to save hundreds of thousands, so you can make that initial investment. The earlier you save up, the faster you'll get the house of your dreams. Also, keep in mind that the higher your down payment is, the easier it'll be for you down the road. Look up saving tips for couples to learn how to budget together. **Improve Your Credit Score** Your credit score is one way to measure your financial health. A good credit score means faster and easier approval of new loans. Building your credit can take months or years, so work on this as soon as possible, especially if you're planning to buy a house for a couple soon. If you have a credit card, avoid going over your credit limit. Also, make sure to pay your monthly balances on time. The same goes for any of your other existing loans. **Get Pre-Approved for a Loan** This is one of the most practical tips for buying a house, especially if you know you can't afford to pay for the costs in full. Before you fixate on any specific property, try getting pre-approved for a loan first. This way, you can gauge how much you can take out based on your financial capacity. You can also manage your expectations in case you're planning to go for something you can't achieve. **Know Your Loan Options** Before taking out a housing loan, make sure you have all the information you need to choose what's best for you. Some options are inevitably better than others. Apart from the Pag-IBIG Fund, several other banks and financial institutions offer home loan programs in the Philippines. One of your best loan options is the Security Bank Home Loan. With this award-winning loan, you can borrow up to 80% of the property's appraised value. Just head on to their website to apply for the Security Bank Home Loan. **Devise a Realistic Plan** Once you have all the key pieces of information, it's time to put them together and come up with a plan. Do this with your partner so you can consider each other's insights. This exercise will also help you gauge your financial compatibility as a couple. Consider how big your family can get. If you see kids in your future, include them in the picture before choosing a house. If you're planning to adopt pets, factor them in as well. Is a garden out front or a spacious yard at the back best for them? Also, do you like a semi-modern house or one that looks more traditional? Do you prefer a simple house interior or one that exudes more personality? How many vehicles do you plan to buy and will you need a garage? Lay these considerations out before you agree on a house for couples. **Get Your Priorities Straight** Remember that not everything will go according to plan. You may not even get to check everything off on your list. That's why it's essential to know your priorities. What are your non-negotiables or must-haves? What can you compromise on? If you're purchasing a foreclosed property, for example, you may not like the original layout of the interior. Maybe the paint is chipped or faded in some areas. Or maybe some of the tiles are broken. But if the property is in an ideal location with a good neighborhood, do the smaller things really matter that much? You can always redecorate anything that's not to your taste. If a property ticks the most important boxes, maybe you can forgive a few shortcomings. Keep an open mind so you can find the right house faster. **Research About Real Estate** This is the best advice for first-time home buyers that you'll do well to take. After all, you live in the golden age of information--take advantage of that. Perform a background check on a developer over the internet. Research other key information like the average price of houses in certain locations, the crime rate, traffic conditions, or even the number of hospitals and schools within the vicinity. **Find the Right Realtor** To make the search for the right house for couples as seamless as possible, work only with a qualified real estate professional. You'll sleep better at night knowing that your future is in the hands of someone with credibility and respectability in their field. The right realtor can also give you practical advice and insights on real estate. **Attend Open Houses** Nothing beats seeing the house you're eyeing in person. Once you identify houses that fit your requirements, go ahead and check them on location. Size up each property and look around the neighborhood. Can you picture yourself living there? If not, at least you can easily cross it off your list. If yes, then maybe you've found your dream home. ### Final Thoughts Buying a house for a couple will likely be one of the biggest purchases you'll ever make--and one that'll impact the rest of your life. Don't rush into it. Take your time and make sure you're financially, emotionally, and mentally prepared to take it on and see it through. If you keep the goal in sight, you'll eventually find the perfect place where you can forge new memories with your loved ones. **Sources:** 1. Down Payment (Investopedia, 2021) 2.

        "Title": "Buying a Home? Get to Know These Property Developers in the Philippines First",
        "Body": "You already know that a real estate property makes a good investment. But you have to understand that the success of such an investment will depend on your decisions early on. Surely you want to avoid buyer's remorse. More importantly, you don't want to waste your hard-earned money on something you don't want or deserve. So, if you're planning to buy a home, you need to work with a reputable property developer in the Philippines. If you're entirely new to home buying, this guide is for you. Foreigners who want to gauge the real estate landscape of the Philippines can benefit from this article as well. ### What is a Property Developer? A property developer in the Philippines is an organization or company that develops real estate assets for profit, such as houses, condominiums, apartments, and commercial buildings. Property developers also build villages, communities, and townships or mixed-use developments that contain residential and commercial properties (e.g. Greenfield District in Mandaluyong, Eton City in Laguna, Vertis North, Arca South, etc.). They cater to different groups of home buyers, so expect that each property developer has client tiers. ### What are the Advantages of Working with a Property Developer in the Philippines? Primarily, buying a home from a property developer will allow you to make the most of your money in the long run. Here are some of the top advantages of working with them: 1. **You Get a High-Quality Real Estate Asset** When you buy from a trusted real estate developer, you have every assurance that you'll get what you pay for or even enjoy privileges that are more than what you've bargained for. For instance, you get to live in a community that's just a few steps away from important facilities and establishments, such as schools, hospitals, transport terminals, and malls. Moreover, you can sleep at night knowing that your home is well-constructed and will not collapse on you. 2. **You Get a Valuable Investment** Real estate assets are investments, and their value is usually influenced by the reputation of the developer. If your property is built by a reputable company, you can expect that it will fetch a high resale value in the future. 3. **Your Family Can Move in On Time** Top property developers in the Philippines are held in high regard. And this well-deserved reputation is all thanks to their commitment to quality and timeliness. If your developer is known for being professional and prompt, you can be confident that your family will be able to move into your new home on time. ### Who are the Top Property Developers in the Philippines? There are a lot of property developers in the Philippines that produce high-quality output. But the following are some of the most outstanding ones: 1. **Ayala Land** Ayala Alabang Village, Alveo, Avida, Amaia--these are only some of the flagship projects of Ayala Land. Being the largest property developer in the Philippines, the company has an unparalleled track record when it comes to developing sustainable communities that also serve as economic centers. Ayala Land is also known for its commercial real estate projects, such as Tower One & Exchange Plaza, Tower 2, Ayala North Exchange, and Solaris One, which are all located inside the Makati Central Business District. 2. **SM Prime Holdings** Another juggernaut in the real estate industry, SM Prime Holdings, Inc. is the company behind SM Supermalls.

Currently, the following developments are part of Filinvest Land's portfolio: Filinvest City in Muntinlupa, Fora in Cavite, Brentville International, and communities under the Futura brand. 4. **Megaworld Corporation** Incorporated in 1984, Megaworld Corporation has business interests in real estate development, marketing, and leasing. Among its most notable projects is Eastwood City. Other than creating malls and office buildings, the company has also been developing upscale townships, such as Capital Town in Pampanga, Arden Botanical Estate in Cavite, Westside City in Paranaque, and Southwoods City in Laguna. 5. **DMCI Homes** The elegant properties of DMCI Homes are sometimes among the top-of-mind choices of people looking to live luxuriously in the metro. This is because the company mainly invests in building condo complexes. Young professionals, starting families, and even seasoned real estate investors can definitely fit right into the lavish condominiums that this company built, such as Cameron Residences, The Crestmont, Maple Place, and Sheridan Towers, among others. 6. **Robinsons Land Corporation** Robinsons Land Corporation doesn't only build office buildings and malls; it also builds condo complexes, townhouses, and mixed-use properties.

Robinsons Land Corporation prides itself on having a wide geographical reach as it has key projects from Ilocos to South Cotabato. 7. **Century Properties** For 30 years, Century Properties has been creating well-appointed neighborhoods and mixed-use estates within and outside the metro. This property developer is the brains behind prominent vertical communities, such as Azure Urban Resort Residences in Paranaque, The Residences at Commonwealth in Quezon City, Acqua Private Residences in Mandaluyong, and Century City in Makati. Century Properties also expands its portfolio by developing provincial lands.

It's a masterclass in seamlessly weaving commercial, lifestyle, and residential properties together. Among its most notable projects are East Bay Residences in Muntinlupa, 8 Benitez Suites, Aruga Apartments, and Proscenium. But Rockwell is more than building exclusive condominium complexes. It has also ventured into horizontal projects, with Rockwell South at Carmelray in Laguna being its first. 9. **Vista Land** Simply known as Vista Land, Vista Land and Lifescapes, Inc.

Doing your legwork will spare you financial disappointments in the future. Here are some of the things that you need to do when choosing a property developer in the Philippines: 1. **Look At Their Reputation** This is not to discount the abilities and the potential of budding property developers in the Philippines. But if you have the money and you don't want to gamble, it's wise to invest in a reputable real estate company--a firm that has a solid track record over the years. Aside from the ones on this list, there are other trusted and esteemed property developers out there that are worth checking out. A quick Google search should give you a list of these companies. 2. **Check Their Projects** If a developer has already caught your eye, the next thing that you need to do is to check their previous or ongoing projects. This way, you'll have an idea of how they design living spaces for their clientele. Checking your potential developer's projects should be easy; you can get a brochure from their agents or visit property platforms, such as Lamudi or Presello. 3. **Visit Open Houses** To see is to believe. If you want to get a feel of how living in your prospective developer's property will be like, visit open houses. Going on such tours won't only allow you to see the property in person but also give you a picture of the neighborhood that you may become part of. Moreover, you get to inspect the developer's quality of work. And should you decide to buy a property from the developer, an open house will help you plan or design your home since model houses are already spruced up. 4. **Talk to Property Owners** Real estate agents may tell you how happy their clients are with their purchase. But always take their words with a grain of salt. Cross-check their claims with existing property owners. Ask about how the project was delivered or how well the developer provided them with after-sales services. ### Final Thoughts Buyer's remorse that you may experience when you choose the wrong property developer in the Philippines will be significant and even long-lasting. After all, you're spending a large sum of money on a real estate asset. Avoid this dilemma by being discerning and meticulous when checking your potential home. Ask your developer lots of questions, and see to it that they have sensible, satisfactory, and practical answers. **Sources:** 1. Ayala Land Investor Relations Page 2. Megaworld Townships 3.

        "Body": "Building your dream home is exciting. You get pumped up as you scour different interior design magazines or watch celebrity house tours on YouTube. However, this endeavor can be challenging. It doesn't stop at pinning inspirations on your mood board or window shopping at IKEA. The actual building process can be messy, especially if you're doing everything on your own. With all these considerations, you'll realize that you need someone who will help you build everything from the ground up. In this case, that would be a house contractor. We've come up with an easy-to-understand guide that will help you learn and appreciate the importance of working with a house contractor in the Philippines.

A house contractor is the company or organization that will build your home. It will be responsible for managing the costs of the entire structure and ensuring that you stay within the set budget. The house contractor will also ensure that all your design plans are feasible and safe.

If you avail of high-quality construction services from the start, there won't be a need for a redo, saving you money in the long run. 3. **You Don't Have to Do the Heavy Lifting** Renovating on your own means doing all the heavy work. But if you work with a local house contractor, you only need to monitor the project's status.

With the beauty and safety of your home ensured, it can fetch a higher price tag if you decide to sell it in the future. ### What are the Cons of Working With a House Contractor in the Philippines? 1. **Services Can Be Expensive** High-quality work comes with a price. The overall cost will depend on the house design and the location of the property. 2. **There May Be Hidden or Unexpected Fees** Unexpected situations during construction, such as price increases in materials or the need to work with subcontractors, can result in additional fees. Always keep tabs on the contractor's expenses and choose a company known for its transparency. 3. **You'll Be Bugged By a Lot of Questions** Contractors may frequently ask for your input to ensure transparency and get your buy-in before proceeding with specific processes. Prepare for some adjustments since unexpected things can happen at the site. 4. **You May Be Forced to Act As a Coordinator** There will be occasions when you'll have to find subcontractors and new vendors to complement the services of your home builders.

With the price index for construction materials hitting an all-time high at 8.3% in May 2022, you might consider buying an existing property instead of building one from scratch.

It's potentially the biggest decision you'll ever make, so you need to look at it from all angles. To help you assess your readiness, we interviewed four young Filipino professionals who successfully bought a home in their twenties: - **Roy**, a former plant operator, bought a property in Batangas to provide better living conditions for his family. - **Ben**, a sales executive, bought a house in Pasig City as a potential investment. - **Cathy**, a former OFW, bought properties in Paranaque and Laguna for her growing family and as an investment. - **Ronald**, an engineer, bought his property at 28 to provide for his family. ### Signs You're Ready to Buy a House in the Philippines Here are signs you can handle the highs and lows of owning a home: 1. **You're Pumped Up About Settling Down** - Settling down can mean owning a house for yourself.

Investor's Lease Act (The Official Gazette) --- **What is the Best House Type for My Family?** House-hunting can be stressful. It involves concerns from picking the right developer to budgeting and dealing with closing costs. The process becomes even more overwhelming if you're not sure what type of property suits your family. Online mortgage broker Nook advises that every house search should start with this question: What does my family need? Understanding your family's lifestyle helps narrow down the best home for you. ### The Best House Type for Your Family Here are four basic types of homes based on the lot structure and how each complements the needs of your family: 1. **Single Detached Property** - A home sitting in the middle of a lot with open space on all four sides. Ideal for families planning to have more children and those who want total privacy. 2. **Single Attached Property** - One side of the house is built on one side of the lot, leaving open space on the other side. Ideal for small to medium families and those looking for a more affordable option than a single detached home. 3. **Townhouse** - A row house sharing walls with other homeowners. Townhouses are usually narrow and vertical, ideal for families on a budget, retirees downsizing, and starter families. 4. **Condominium** - Units within a building, with shared spaces like gyms and pools. Ideal for small families, those who prefer low maintenance, and those wanting to be close to city conveniences. ### Where Should We Live? - **City Living**: Condominiums are the best choice for young professionals and career-oriented families. Single-detached, single-attached houses, and townhomes are available but expensive. - **Suburban Living**: Consider areas like Cavite and Laguna for a quieter lifestyle. Key developments include: - **Laguna**: Nuvali, Eton City, Valenza, Greenfield City, Southwoods City - **Cavite**: Vermosa, Lancaster New City, The Island Park, Maple Grove, South Forbes City, Suntrust Ecotown, Southwoods City - **Northern Provinces**: Bulacan and Pampanga offer larger homes at lower prices. Key developments include: - **Bulacan**: Altaraza, Amaia Scapes, Camella - **Pampanga**: Capital Town, The Resort Residences, Alviera, Claremont ### Financing Your Chosen House Type After finding the best house type for your family, the next step is the acquisition process. Start with the down payment. Consider these financing options: 1. **Bank Financing** - Banks offer various interest rates, loan terms, and payment schemes. 2. **Pag-IBIG Financing** - The PAG-IBIG Fund Housing loan lets you borrow up to PHP 6 million. 3. **In-House Financing** - Pay your amortization directly to the property developer, common with pre-selling properties. 4. **Rent-To-Own** - Lease the property with an option to buy it later at a locked-in price. ### Final Thoughts When buying a home for your family, consider factors that influence convenience and future plans. The best house type will suit your lifestyle, help you save money, and maximize the property's value. Working with an online mortgage broker like Nook can simplify the process and help you find the best home loan. **Sources:** 1. The Pros and Cons of Townhouses (Backman, MillionAcres, 2020) 2.

If you're planning on buying a house at 30, we've created a comprehensive guide to help you out. ### Is the 30s a Good Age to Buy a House? Whether you're a millennial moving out of your parents' home or a young Gen Z-er planning ahead, buying a house at 30 is a great idea. Here's why: ** You're Financially Wiser** Gone are the days when YOLO was your mantra. Now, you've likely settled major debts and saved money for your home's down payment. ** You've Built a Good Credit History** A good credit score is crucial for loan applications. By 30, you've probably improved your credit history, increasing your chances of getting a favorable loan offer. ** You Can Afford Higher Monthly Payments** In your 30s, you may have a higher salary, allowing you to afford shorter mortgage terms, reducing the total interest paid. ** Your Career is Already Established** A stable job ensures you can cover ongoing homeownership costs like insurance, utilities, and unexpected expenses. ** You've Already Decided Where to Live** You know what your permanent address should look like, considering future plans like starting a family or investing in property. ### Buying a House at 30: 7 Steps to Owning Your Dream Home Buying a house in the Philippines involves multiple steps and coordination with various agencies.

Use the 30/30/3 rule: spend no more than 30% of your monthly salary on home loan repayments, save at least 30% of the home's value in cash, and buy a home worth no more than three times your annual income. **2. Get Pre-Qualified for a Mortgage** Find out how much banks are willing to lend you. This helps you understand your borrowing capacity and which banks you can borrow from. **3. Save Up for a Down Payment** A down payment is typically at least 20% of the purchase price. Start saving early and consider automating your savings to build up the necessary funds. **4. List Down Your Must-Haves** Make a checklist of what you want in a home, including location, amenities, property type, size, and developer reputation. **5. Shop for Homes** Search for properties online through real estate developers and property listing websites. Consider getting a PRC-licensed real estate agent to help you. **6. Visit Possible Properties to Buy** Schedule visits to personally view each home. Ask important questions during open houses to ensure the property meets your needs. **7. Get a Home Loan** Once you find a home, secure a loan to finance your purchase. Consider options like Pag-IBIG housing loans, in-house financing, or traditional bank loans. ### Enjoy an Easy Application Process with a Security Bank Home Loan Security Bank Home Loan offers flexible loan terms, fixed low interest rates, and high loan amounts.

        "Title": "Should You Buy or Build a House? Important Things to Consider",
        "Body": "As you plan to settle down, raise a family, or make your first real estate investment, one of the things you need to consider is whether to buy or build a house. The good news is 2022 might be the best time to do it, with the real estate scene gradually recovering amid the pandemic. But how do you know if it's more practical to purchase a home than build it from the ground up? What are the considerations before signing the contract or making the down payment? In this guide, we'll help you decide if you should buy or build a house by delving into the pros and cons, so you'll know what to consider. ## Pros and Cons of Buying a House Buying a house can be overwhelming, especially if it's your first time. You have to consider the location, your budget, the features of the house, and the documents that come with the property. But it's also a good investment and a milestone that you should be mighty proud of. If you're considering buying one, first know the pros and cons of buying a house. ### Advantages of Buying a House **Move in Anytime:** Buying an already-built house means that you can move in as soon as your paperwork is done. If you're in a time crunch, buying one will give you a place to settle in quickly. **Save Time:** If you don't have the luxury of time to coordinate with contractors or visit the site for inspection, buying a house is a great option. The house is already built, so you don't need to spend time on construction. **Needs Only Minor Renovations:** If you find a house that's close to your vision, buying a property is a great option. You can personalize it without major construction projects. **Less Stress:** Purchasing a house means you don't have to worry about construction and related expenses. You will have an idea of the price, transfer fees, and other costs related to the acquisition. **You Know How Much You Need:** When planning to buy a house, you can negotiate with the owner or broker to fit your budget. ### Disadvantages of Buying a House **High Upfront Costs:** Buying a house outright means you'll need to pay the total amount upfront. **You Can't Have It All:** Finding a house that meets all your needs and budget can be challenging. You may need to compromise on certain aspects. **The Age of the House Matters:** Older houses may require more repairs, which can be costly in the long run. **Other People are Looking at It, Too:** The house you want may be in high demand, so it's possible someone else might buy it before you. ## Pros and Cons of Building Your Own Home Building your own home allows you to construct your house according to your vision and maximize every living space on your lot. But it also comes with disadvantages. ### Advantages of Building Your Own Home **Total Control Over the Property:** You can choose the location, design, materials, and style of your house. **No Competing Buyers:** When the land is yours, you can decide when to build your dream house without competing with other buyers. **You Can Manage Costs:** You have control over construction costs and can choose more sustainable options. **Lesser Need for Repairs and Maintenance:** New materials mean fewer repairs and maintenance in the future. ### Disadvantages of Building Your Own Home **Unexpected Costs:** Additional expenses are inevitable due to fluctuating prices of construction materials and changes in the construction plan. **Takes Time to Build:** Building a house from scratch can take between six months to a year or more. **More Stress:** Monitoring construction progress can be stressful, requiring time off work and constant communication with contractors. ## Which is Cheaper: Buying or Building a House? The cost of buying or building a house depends on various factors, such as location, upfront costs, materials used, and processing fees. Buying a house may seem more expensive upfront, but building a house can accumulate similar or higher costs over time. ## Should You Buy or Build a House? What to Consider Now that you know the pros and cons of buying and building a house, here are some questions to ask before making your decision: - Why are you considering buying or building a house? - What's your budget or the maximum amount you're comfortable spending? - What style do you prefer, and what type of house is best for your family? - What are your non-negotiable features in a house? - Where's your ideal location? - Are you ready to buy a house, or will you consider buying a condo? ## Final Thoughts Whether you want to buy or build a house, you need to do your research. Determine if buying or building a house suits your needs and if you're financially ready to pay for everything related to owning or building a house. Decide on the kind of home you envision for yourself and your family. Be sure to weigh your options and talk to experts so that you're well-guided. **Sources:** - Real Estate Prospects Look Bright in 2022 (Manila Times, November 2021)",

        "Body": "Having a place to call your own is everyone's dream. Pandemic or not, all we want is to provide a safe and comfortable place for ourselves and our loved ones. This desire comes with the decision to buy or rent a house. Renting is probably the easier choice. However, when you rent, you can't stay in your house forever because you don't own it. On the other hand, buying a house guarantees you'll have a house to live in for the long term. But the initial considerations are quite taxing and dependent on your financial capacity. In this article, you'll learn more about the factors to consider when choosing to buy or rent a house. ## What's the Difference Between Renting and Owning a House? To move out of your parents' home and get your own place is quite a goal. It's a huge decision that could affect your finances and your life as a whole. Renting can be an option because it allows you to occupy a living space just by paying monthly rent to the owner. Just remember that regardless of how long you've rented the house, it doesn't make you the owner of the house. Buying a house is a different story. You automatically become the owner of the house after payments have been made and the paperwork is done. Whether you buy it in installments or in cash, you have authority over the property, which means you can sell it or have it rented out. ## Financial Considerations When You Buy or Rent a House Your financial capacity is a huge factor when deciding whether to buy or rent a house. At a glance, it looks like renting a house is better than buying one. If you don't have a big budget, renting is more economical since you only need to pay one month's rent in advance plus two months' deposit. For example, if you're planning to get a house that costs PHP 10,000 to rent per month, you only need to prepare PHP 30,000 for the advance and the deposit. On the other hand, if you're going to buy a house, you need to settle a lot of upfront payments: - Down payment, which is up to 20% of the property's total cost - Reservation fee, which is at least PHP 10,000 depending on the size and location - Real Property Tax, equivalent to 1% or 2% of the house's current market value - Water and electricity installation cost - Home insurance - Other taxes included in home ownership Here's a simple but effective guide to help you decide whether to buy or rent a house. | When to Buy a House | When to Rent a House | |--------------------|----------------------| | The property costs no more than 2.5x your salary and you can afford the payments and taxes. | The rental costs are lower than the expected monthly installment when you buy a house. | | You have enough savings to cover the down payment and other upfront fees. | Your savings are not enough to cover upfront home ownership costs. | | You have several streams of income that can support your monthly payments on the house. | You have limited sources of income. | | You have decided to stay at a specific location for the long term. | You are temporarily considering settling in a location for employment, education, or other short-term goals. | ## The Pros and Cons of Renting or Owning a House Whether you're buying or renting a house, each option has its advantages and disadvantages. Knowing the pros and cons can help you prepare financially. ### Pros of Renting a House - **More flexibility**: You can easily leave the property if you need to, as long as you don't break your rental agreement. - **Fewer responsibilities**: The landlord is responsible for conducting regular maintenance checks to ensure that the house is safe to live in. - **Fixed monthly expense**: Renting a house means paying a fixed monthly rental fee. - **Liquidity**: If you choose to rent, you don't need to pay the upfront costs of home ownership. Instead, you can use this money to start a business or invest. ### Cons of Renting a House - **Yearly contract renewal**: Your landlord may ask you to renew the contract every year as security. - **Yearly rental increase**: Your landlord may set a yearly rental increase, which is at least 5% of the current rental cost. - **No pets and no children allowed**: Sometimes, you won't be allowed to rent a house if you have pets or kids. - **Park at your own risk**: Most houses for rent, especially in Metro Manila, may have limited parking spaces. - **Bound by rules**: Since you signed an agreement with the homeowner, you need to comply with what's stated in the contract. ### Pros of Buying a House - **Stability**: Having a place to call your own gives you a sense of stability. - **Freedom to renovate and modify**: Since you own the house, you have the freedom to change the wall paint or the sink anytime. - **Privacy**: When you own the house, you get to decide who can access it. - **Investment**: Real estate has the potential to increase in value over time. ### Cons of Buying a House - **Initial upfront cash**: Buying a house requires you to pay for initial fees and renovation costs. - **Pay taxes**: Taxes and other fees that go with home ownership usually go higher as years pass. - **More responsibilities**: Since you're the owner of the house, it's your responsibility to maintain it and settle all financial obligations related to owning a house. ## Questions to Ask Before You Buy or Rent a House Buying or renting a house largely depends on your financial status. But there are other factors to consider before making a decision. Here are a few helpful questions to ask: ### Can I Afford to Buy a House? If yes, then why rent? If you have enough funds to purchase a home and pay for the upfront fees, then buy your dream house. ### How Long Am I Planning to Stay in This Location? Your life plans will affect your decision to buy or rent a house. If you're planning to move out after a few years, then rent a house. However, if you see yourself having your own family and staying put for decades, then purchase your own house. ### Am I Looking for Flexibility or Stability? If you feel like your plans can change in the next few months and don't want to be tied down to your home, then go ahead and look for houses for rent. However, if you're planning to put down roots somewhere, then buying a home is the right decision. ### Do I Have a Lot of Outstanding Debts? Your credit score and your ability to pay are two important considerations. If you have a lot of debts, then maybe your home ownership plans can be shelved for now. It's better to reduce or settle all your debts first before taking on another long-term financial commitment. ## Final Thoughts To buy or rent a house? It's a huge decision that requires careful financial consideration. Renting can be much cheaper than buying. But you're investing your money when you purchase a house. If you're still undecided, spend some time determining your short-term and long-term goals to see whether renting or buying aligns with them. Plan, weigh the pros and cons, and look for options on how you can fund your dream of getting your own place. ## Source: - Properties for Sale (Acquired Assets) (Pag-IBIG, 2021)",

        "Title": "Millennials and Gen Zs: Here's How to Own Your Dream Home",
        "Body": "Are you afraid of being in your 30s? You shouldn't be. It sounds cliched, but the best is yet to come. You can always consider this phase an upgrade because you've become wiser, bolder, and more grounded. Plus, your 30s offers a lot of exciting achievements waiting to be unlocked, such as home ownership. If you're planning on buying a house at 30, we've created a comprehensive guide to help you out. ## Is the 30s a Good Age to Buy a House? Whether you're a millennial looking to move out of your parents' home or a young Gen Z-er planning as early as now to buy a house in your 30s, it's never too late! Buying a house at 30 is actually the best age to buy a house. Here's why:  **You're Financially Wiser** Gone are the days when YOLO was your ultimate mantra. You've stopped burning cash on lifestyle luxuries that prove your upward social mobility. Instead of buying handcrafted coffees every day or updating your phone every time there's a new release, you've also started building your wealth through investing, freelancing, or running a business on the side. Buying a house at 30 just makes sense because you've likely already taken care of major debts, thus giving you a clean slate. Because you're financially wiser, you've probably already saved money for your home's down payment.  **You've Built a Good Credit History** Unless you can pay your property in cash, you'll need to apply for a housing loan. Banks and lending companies, however, check their applicants' credit scores. Your credit score is important since it represents your trustworthiness and capability to pay back. Most people in their 20s haven't sorted out their financial priorities yet, which explains why many of them have a lot of debt. Debts can affect your credit score, affecting your loan application's odds of success. This is why buying a house at 30 is your best bet. There's a great chance that you've settled the majority of your financial obligations and improved your credit history, which means you have better odds of scoring a favorable loan offer.  **You Can Afford Higher Monthly Payments** One possible downside of getting a home in your younger years is that you may be forced to go for a longer loan term since this means lower monthly payments. Moreover, this may be the only tenor your salary can afford. Ultimately, with a long loan term, you'll pay the interest for longer. But if you're buying a house at 30, you may find yourself with a higher salary. You can now afford shorter mortgage terms, such as 10, 15, or 20 years. The monthly payments may be higher, but they'll keep you from paying a large sum of interest.  **Your Career is Already Established** Being in your 30s may mean that you've already found a job or career that you'll stick to in the years to come. Job security is important when it comes to homeownership for two reasons. One, banks and lending firms want to see that you have a steady flow of income. Second, home ownership doesn't just end with down payments and monthly mortgages. You have to take the insurance, utilities, renovations, and unexpected home expenses into account. You can pay for these expenditures only if you have a stable job that pays well.  **You've Already Decided Where to Live** After years of moving from one apartment to the next, you already have an idea of what your permanent address while living in the Philippines should look like. You've already taken into account your future plans, such as starting a family or retiring in a peaceful community far from the metro's hustle and bustle. If you're an enterprising individual, you might have even considered your potential home as an investment asset to rent out for extra cash or even to resell. ## Buying a House at 30: 7 Steps to Owning Your Dream Home Buying a house for sale in the Philippines is not an easy feat. It's multi-layered, and it requires you to speak to different agencies and people. As such, proper coordination and organizational skills are a must. To make the entire process efficient, here are some things you need to keep in mind. ### 1. Decide on Your Home-Buying Budget Buying your first home in the Philippines? Many first-time homebuyers immediately start shopping for properties without setting a budget first. Avoid this common mistake because it'll tempt you to spend your money on something you can't afford. It's easy to fall in love with a stylish house with a breathtaking view. But what if it turns out to be expensive? So that your home purchase decision won't be driven by emotion, determine a budget for buying your first house. How much can you really afford to buy a home? The rule of thumb is to follow the 30/30/3 rule for home buying: spend no more than 30% of your monthly salary on home loan repayments, save at least 30% of the home's value in cash, and buy a home worth no more than three times your annual income. This way, you can avoid overextending your budget. By setting aside the cash, you also have a bit of a financial cushion in case of emergencies. But this is just one way to estimate how much you can spend on a home. Your budget should still be based on your own financial situation. You can also use an online calculator, one that computes how much you can borrow from lenders to buy a home based on your income. Think long-term, too. Don't overestimate your financial capacity to buy a home. You may be earning well in the present, but your employment status may change in the future. Be a bit conservative when estimating your home-buying budget. ### 2. Get Pre-Qualified for a Mortgage Aside from knowing how much you can afford, it's equally important to find out how much banks are willing to lend you. What you think you can afford won't necessarily match what lenders think you can afford. This is because banks look at different factors, such as credit score and employment history, to evaluate a borrower's ability to repay a home loan. This is why you should never skip the pre-qualification process in your home-buying journey. Getting pre-qualified lets you know how much you can borrow to buy a home and which banks you're qualified to borrow from. Traditional pre-qualification follows a rather rigorous process. You'll go to each lender, submit your personal and financial information (salary, occupation, employers, sources of income, etc.) for review, and wait for the entire process to be completed. ### 3. Save Up for a Down Payment Once you know how much you can afford and how much you can actually spend on a new home, the next thing you must prepare for is the down payment. A down payment is an amount--specifically, a percentage of the property value--that home buyers pay out of pocket to buy a home. Wondering how much you'll need to shell out for a downpayment for a house in the Philippines? It's typically at least 20% of the purchase price. The remaining balance can be paid over a certain period through a home loan. Buying a condo unit worth P1.5 million, for instance, will have you shelling out at least P300,000 in down payment. Not everyone can pay such a huge amount upfront. So how to afford a house in the Philippines? Start saving for your down payment as early as possible. It takes discipline, hard work, perseverance, and negotiation skills to overcome this challenge. Even if you know how to buy a house in the Philippines, you still need to prove to lenders that you're financially capable. You can do this by saving enough to cover the down payment upfront. This should motivate you to keep going until you hit your savings goal. Here are a few tips to effectively save money for your down payment on a home: - Set aside a fixed amount (from your salary, bonuses, 13th-month pay, and other income sources) specifically for your home purchase savings. To make this much easier for you, automate your savings. - Find additional income sources (e.g., freelancing jobs, low-capital small business, etc.) if your paycheck isn't enough to save for a down payment. - Have a separate savings account for your down payment fund. Ideally, open a high-interest bank account with a passbook and no ATM card, so you can't easily withdraw the money for other expenses. - Prioritize your crucial expenses and let go of frivolous spending. - Negotiate with the developer or bank so you can make down payments in monthly installments for one to two years instead of a larger one-time payment. ### 4. List Down Your Must-Haves Before you start visiting houses for sale in the Philippines, make a checklist of what you want in a home. This will help you narrow down your options and make your search for the perfect home a lot faster. Consider the following important factors: - **Location**: Is the neighborhood safe? Is it close to public transport, hospitals, schools, and commercial establishments? You may think that the city is the best location for a home because of its convenience. But if you scope the suburbs of nearby provinces, you may find an address that's ideal for your lifestyle and future goals. - **Amenities**: What amenities are important to you? Swimming pool? Gym? Basketball court? Children's playground? - **Property type**: Are you looking for an apartment, condo, or house and lot, or other house types? - **Property size**: What's your preferred number of bedrooms and bathrooms, floor area, and land size? Do you want a big garden? Are you planning to have at least three cars in the garage? - **Property status**: Are you willing to buy an RFO (ready for occupancy), pre-selling, or foreclosed property? Have you considered rent-to-own homes? Remember that a property's price is also based on its status. For one, RFOs are more expensive than pre-selling properties. Foreclosed properties can also come cheap, depending on their physical condition. - **Real estate developer**: Does the developer have a good track record of building high-quality projects and completing them on time? Is it a reputable company? Read reviews and testimonials, or ask your family and friends who own property built by your prospective developer. ### 5. Shop for Homes Search for properties with features you want and prices within your price range. You can browse homes online through real estate developers and property listing websites. You may choose to shop around on your own. Or better yet, get a PRC-licensed real estate agent or broker to help you find homes for sale and guide you through the entire home-buying process. ### 6. Visit Possible Properties to Buy List down the properties you're considering and schedule a visit with your agent to personally view each home. Contact the seller or developer and arrange for an ocular visit. Open houses are a great opportunity to inspect your potential home and see your developer's quality of work. And since you're inside the actual home, you can easily envision the future look of your space based on your aesthetic taste and plans. This step may take time, especially if you're always busy. But don't rush it--take as much time as you need to make sure you choose the right home to buy. Here are some things you may want to bring up to your agent during open houses: - In case you're planning to buy a \"secondhand\" or old property, ask your agent why it's for sale. Doing this may reveal some pitfalls or red flags. While you're at it, ask how long the house has been on the market. - If you're buying a new home and you're visiting a model house, ask the agent if you can visit other finished homes within the village. That way, you'll be able to see if the quality of work is consistent. - Ask your agent if you can apply some upgrades or modifications to the new home after you buy it. - If you're buying a pre-selling home, ask about the timeline of the construction and the expected date of turnover. - Whether you're buying a pre-selling or an old home, ask if there is a homeowner's association. If there is, expect that there'll be additional fees that you'll need to cover. ### 7. Get a Home Loan Found a home that meets all your requirements? Great! The next step is to secure a loan for financing your home purchase. You can apply for a Pag-IBIG housing loan if you're looking for a longer term and lower interest rates. Check out in-house financing, or the loan facilitated by the property developer, as well. Intimidated by the idea of applying for a housing loan from a bank? After all, there's a sea of banks out there with an assortment of offers. On top of that, you need to take care of a long list of documentary requirements. With a Security Bank Home Loan, you can now apply with ease--just head to the Security Bank website to proceed with your application. It's one of the best options out there, even winning the Product of the Year Award at the Asian Banking and Finance's Wholesale and Retail Banking Awards in 2019. Take a look at its features: - **Flexible loan terms**: Enjoy repayment terms of up to 25 years. Pay for a maximum of 15 years for a residential vacant lot or condominium unit, a maximum of 20 years for a townhouse or duplex, and a maximum of 25 years for a house and lot. - **Fixed, low interest rates**: Enjoy one of the lowest interest rates in the market, starting at 7% for one year, 7.25% for three years, and 7.75% for five years. - **High loan amount**: Borrow up to 80% of the property's appraised value. Loan amounts range from P1 million to P10 million. - **All-In Financing option**: Worried about bank fees?

This means you won't have to pay them immediately--just pay them together with your monthly payments throughout the loan term.

        "Title": "Pros and Cons of Buying a House: What to Know Before the Big Purchase",
        "Body": "We all have dreams, and most of us share the same goal: to own a house. But before you can enjoy decorating your home and inviting people over, you need to go through the process of finding a house, securing the funding, and constructing or adding the finishing touches. In short, it can be a tedious, time-consuming, and costly undertaking. To manage your expectations and help prepare your budget, you need to know the pros and cons of buying a house. ## The Pros and Cons of Buying a House in the Philippines ### What are the Advantages of Buying a House? Owning a house has many obvious advantages. Understanding the benefits of buying one can help you make a more straightforward decision if you're still unsure whether you're ready to buy a house or not. Here are some of them. ###  Can Be Cheaper Than Renting While renting may seem cheaper than buying a house, home ownership costs less. When you buy a house, your payment goes towards ownership. Every monthly amortization payment brings you closer to calling the house your own. Paying rent month after month, even for years, won't make the property yours. ###  Full Control Over Your Property When you buy a house, you are your landlord. You have complete control over your property. You can design, remodel, and decorate without any restrictions. Whether you need to do minor repairs or a major overhaul, you can do so freely as long as it's up to code. Moreover, you no longer have to deal with the hassle of renewing your rent agreement or renegotiating your rental terms. You also don't need to worry about the possibility of sudden termination of your lease agreement. As long as your home loan payments are up-to-date, you enjoy security with your property. ###  Good Investment You're spending money on something tangible and essential with the potential to appreciate over time. You're also increasing your wealth by building equity, meaning the property's current market value minus what you owe on it. The acquisition of a house is also a capital gain, which is an increase in the value of a capital asset when sold. The property will have a higher worth than the original purchase price. Investors also consider real estate as a good investment because people will always need a house to live in. You'll find that there will always be buyers of residential homes. Research and buy an affordable house in an up-and-coming neighborhood. Your property's value will grow as the area becomes more popular or developed. If you're not going to live in it yet, you have the option to turn it into a rental property. ###  No Need to Compromise When looking for houses for rent, your instinct might be to find the cheapest one that also meets your size, amenities, and location requirements. Sometimes, you'll still rent a house even if it doesn't meet all your needs or expectations. But you don't need to settle for anything less when you buy a house. You can ensure that the place ticks all the boxes and that you get your money's worth. ###  Having Your Own Space There's no place like home. At the end of a long day, knowing that you have a house to come home to can be the most rewarding feeling. Having your own nest can also bring you a sense of comfort and security. ###  Enjoy Easy Home Financing Options Because of easy financing options offered by banks, lending institutions, and property developers in the Philippines, buying a house has never been easier. You don't have to wait until you save enough money to purchase a house. You can even buy a home in your 30s if you meet the lender's eligibility requirements and can afford the monthly amortization. ## What are the Disadvantages of Buying a House? Is it worthwhile to buy a house? That depends on many factors. It's crucial to know the advantages and disadvantages of buying or owning a house before you make the big decision and part with your hard-earned money. So here are some drawbacks you might experience when buying a house. ###  Property Value Might Depreciate Buying a house is a significant achievement you should be proud of. It's also an excellent long-term investment. But you must also understand that your property's value will depend on market conditions, which won't always be enjoying a boom period or moving in an upward direction. For instance, despite Philippine residential real estate prices increasing steadily since 2016, there were periods when prices declined during the pandemic--particularly in the first half of 2021 and the third quarter of 2020. ###  Less Flexibility Packing up and moving to a new city or country won't be easy. Compared to renting a house, with which you can turn over the rental property to the landlord and move out, the process of selling your house won't be as quick. It can be more complicated and stressful with all the paperwork and costly with all the fees to pay. ###  Limited Options Buying a house entails many considerations, and these can narrow down your options. Aside from budget, you need to consider the location, size of the house, community, and security, just to name a few. Finding a house that matches all your preferences won't be easy. More often than not, you'll need to settle for a place that meets only some of your requirements. ###  Paying for Everything Aside from the high upfront costs, you're also financially responsible for everything. There's no landlord to take care of repairs or the upkeep for you. You'll have to either learn how to fix the damage yourself or pay someone to do it. And the bigger your house is, the bigger the utility bills and maintenance fees to pay. ###  Some Stiff Competition Remember that you're not the only person shopping for a house with the same budget and requirements in mind. If you don't move quickly, you might lose your chance of buying the house you want. With that, you'll need to get pre-approved for a housing loan and pay more than the minimum down payment. You can then avoid delays and close the deal as soon as possible. ## Final Thoughts Buying a house is a major decision you shouldn't make on a whim. It will affect your financial future for years to come, so learn all you can about the housing market to expedite your decision-making process. Know the pros and cons of buying a house to maximize the benefits and handle the drawbacks better.",

        "Body": "Starting a business can be exciting, but it also comes with important legal requirements. In the Philippines, a crucial step to setting up your sole proprietor business is registering with the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI). Your DTI registration grants you the legal and exclusive right to use your business name (within its validity period; renewable every five years). This means that no other business can use your business name in the locations covered by your DTI registration. #### Benefits of DTI Registration **Legal recognition**: Registering your business with DTI helps you build legitimacy and credibility among customers, suppliers, investors, and other important stakeholders. It also boosts customer confidence by showing that your business follows legal practices, which can improve trust in your products or services. **Protects your business identity**: DTI registration gives you exclusive use of your business name, reducing the risk of brand confusion and potential legal disputes. It also protects your business identity from unauthorized use or infringement, making it easier to enforce your intellectual property rights if needed. **Access to important services and incentives**: DTI-registered businesses gain access to valuable government services and incentives. These may include business permits, government contracts, training programs, and other resources that can help your business grow. **Payment acceptance**: DTI registration is a prerequisite for accepting card payments, an essential payment method if you want to expand and grow fast. For example, you will need a DTI registration to activate card payments on your online payment gateway. **Easier compliance with tax requirements**: DTI registration is often a prerequisite for obtaining a Tax Identification Number (TIN) from the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR). Having a TIN is essential for fulfilling tax obligations, ensuring that your business can operate legally. **Expansion opportunities**: If you plan to expand your business in the future, DTI registration provides a solid foundation for setting up a business entity and securing financing in new markets. #### Eligibility for DTI Business Registration Most business owners are eligible to apply for the DTI business registration. You can apply for DTI business name registration if you meet these criteria: - Filipino citizens and foreign nationals who are at least 18 years old. If you are a foreign national below 18 years of age, you may submit documentation that you come from a country where the legal age is below 18. - Refugee or stateless persons. #### Step-by-Step DTI Business Registration Follow these steps to set up your DTI business registration.

These may include: - Owner's Information - Business Scope - Business Name - Business Address - Personal Information - Residence Address - Check through the details carefully after completing the form. 4. **Review the Undertaking**, which offers details on your responsibilities as a business owner. 5. **Pay your DTI registration fee** using the available payment methods -- credit card, debit card, GCash, or OTC payments. Payment must be received within seven calendar days, or your application will be voided. Once you have paid, you will receive a payment confirmation. 6. **Check your email for your Certificate of Business Name Registration**. #### What's Next After DTI Registration? Now that your business is registered with DTI, you can apply for a business permit to operate your business. Depending on your business's location, you'll need to apply for local business permits from the city or municipal government. These permits are essential for operating legally within the area and may include a Mayor's Permit, Barangay Clearance, and other relevant licenses.

        "Body": "New years are not just about fresh starts, they're about renewals too! And we're not just talking about vows here, but of the adulting kind: renewal of licenses, clearances, and even accreditation for some businesses out there. For those entering the workforce, the NBI clearance becomes a crucial document for employment application. Fresh graduates rely on it as one of the primary government IDs, while existing employees might need to renew it at their HR's request. #### What exactly is an NBI Clearance? This is a document, issued by the National Bureau of Investigation, that verifies that you are free of any criminal activities or liabilities in the country. With this clearance, you are now free to proceed with your employment, apply for other government IDs, and other processes that will require any proof of identification from you. #### How do I get one? Back in the heydays, you would need to go to an NBI branch to apply for your NBI clearance. But over the years, the bureau has made applying for one easier. You can even get one from an SM Supermall! To give you the latest and up-to-date information about how to get an NBI Clearance, we tried applying for one from the NBI website itself. Here are the things we learned: 1. Go to [NBI Clearance Online Services](https://clearance.nbi.gov.ph) to register for an account. If you already have an existing account, simply log in to proceed. 2. Once logged in, you will be asked to key in your personal information including address, family background, and educational background. 3. You will be asked to select a valid government ID from the dropdown menu. You will also be asked to provide the corresponding ID number in the succeeding field. Note: you will need to bring this ID when you go to the NBI center later on. 4. Next, select the NBI branch where you'll process your application. Once you've chosen your preferred branch, you can then select the date and time for your visit. 5. The next step is for you to make your payment through the following options: bank over the counter, online bank, cash payments (via Bayad Centers or LBC), ECPay, via 7-Eleven, VISA/Mastercard, GCash, Maya, Shopee Pay, or via the DragonPay app. The NBI Clearance (referred to as \"Multi-Purpose Clearance\" on the website) is worth PHP 130.00. Depending on your chosen payment method, additional fees may apply. When paying through GCash, for example, there is a system fee of PHP 30.00, so the total amount that you need to pay is PHP 160.00. 6. Upon selecting your payment method, you'll receive a reference number--keep this safe. You'll need it both during the payment process and as your entry pass to the NBI Clearance Processing area. 7. Next, head to your selected NBI branch on your appointment date. Ensure you have your reference number readily available along with at least two valid government IDs. 8. Once your name is called, the NBI staff will capture your biometric data. 9. If a \"hit\" occurs--meaning someone with a similar name has a criminal record--the NBI will need to further check their records and you'll need to return on another day to claim your NBI clearance. Otherwise, if there are no issues, you can obtain your clearance on the same day. #### How do I renew my NBI Clearance? We also tried the process for renewing NBI Clearance, and here's what we learned from their website: 1. From the NBI homepage, choose \"Click Here\" under the NBI Clearance Online Renewal box. 2. Provide the details required, including your old NBI ID number. Please take note that only NBI Clearances issued from October 16, 2016 onwards can renew through this channel. However, if your clearance was issued before this date, you can renew it using the same process as if applying for a new one. 3. Once verified, the next page is for you to choose your preferred delivery method: pick-up or door-to-door delivery. 4. The next step is for you to pay the necessary fees. For pick-up, the total fee amounts to PHP 160.00, which covers the PHP 30.00 e-Payment service fee. You'll also have the option to select your preferred NBI Branch for pick-up. To streamline the process, it's advisable to contact the NBI hotlines at 8524-1277, 8522-8788, or 8523-8231 to 38 local 5523, 5430, or 5509 to confirm the availability of your NBI clearance for pick-up. Opting for door-to-door delivery requires a total payment of PHP 369.00, inclusive of the delivery charge. Please note that this amount will vary depending on the delivery location. Delivery timelines typically range from 3-7 days for Metro Manila and 7-10 days for Visayas and Mindanao. #### Additional Information - You cannot walk-in at any NBI branch to get your NBI Clearance. - If you miss your appointment without completing the payment, the system will automatically cancel it, and you will have to make another appointment. - If you miss your appointment but have already made payment, you still have a 15-day window to finalize your application. - Valid government IDs that you can provide during application are: passport, driver's license, UMID, TIN ID, National ID, Postal ID, PhilHealth ID, Voter's ID, PWD ID, Senior Citizen ID, PRC ID, PSA Birth Certificate, and Police Clearance. - First-time job seekers, as per Republic Act No. 11261, qualify for a free NBI Clearance.

        "Body": "#### Why is it Important to Get NBI Clearance? As the name implies, the NBI Clearance is issued by the Philippines' National Bureau of Investigation. It's an essential document that proves you are not involved in any criminal activity in the country and therefore can be cleared for a number of applications. The NBI Clearance is a typical requirement when applying for a job locally or abroad, starting a business, studying overseas, taking the civil service exam, or getting other government-issued IDs like the PhilSys National ID. #### What are the Requirements for Your Appointment? Thankfully, applicants no longer have to get a head-start in the day when applying for their NBI Clearance (where most would try to beat the long lines by waking up way before office hours begin).

Before you schedule your visit, though, applicants should prepare the following requirements: - Two (2) valid government-issued IDs: - Passport - Driver's license - UMID - PhilHealth ID - TIN ID - Postal ID - Voter's ID - PRC ID - Senior Citizen ID - OFW ID - National ID - PSA Birth Certificate - PWD ID - Police Clearance - Barangay Certification (for first-time job seekers) First-time job seekers are eligible for a free NBI Clearance under the First Time Jobseekers Assistance Act.

        "Title": "PhilHealth Contribution Rate Now at 5% this 2024",
        "Body": "MANILA, Philippines -- On January 12, the Philippine Health Insurance Corp. (PhilHealth) announced its decision to proceed with the scheduled hike in member contributions for 2024. The adjustment will result in the premium rate increasing from the existing 4% to 5%. At the same time, the maximum monthly basic salary ceiling will go up from P80,000 to P100,000. These adjustments follow the Universal Health Care Act, passed by President Duterte in 2019, which mandates an increase in premium contributions to 5% for the years 2024 and 2025. With these changes, employers will need to plan and adjust their payroll systems to accommodate the increased PhilHealth premium rates. Read more to learn how the latest PhilHealth contribution changes affect your business to stay ahead in 2024. Understanding PhilHealth Contributions and Premium Rates What Is a PhilHealth Contribution? A PhilHealth contribution is a payment that individuals and employers make to the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation. It helps fund a health insurance program that provides coverage for medical expenses of Filipinos. By law, most citizens are required to pay into PhilHealth through deductions from their salary if employed, or through individually paid premium contributions if self-employed or unemployed. It aims to help make healthcare more financially-accessible and provide a safety net for all Filipinos during medical emergencies or hospitalizations. Who Are the Different Types of PhilHealth Contributors? There are two types of PhilHealth contributors: direct and indirect contributors. Direct Contributors Formally employed workers Kasambahays Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) Self-employed and professional practitioners Filipinos living abroad, including those with dual citizenship. Lifetime members All Filipinos aged 21 and above who can afford to pay Indirect Contributors Indigents identified by the DSWD Senior citizens Beneficiaries of Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps) Persons with disabilities (PWDs) Previously identified at point-of-service / sponsored by LGUs Sangguniang Kabataan officials Filipinos aged 21 and above who cannot afford direct payments What is a Philhealth Contribution Rate? The PhilHealth contribution rate is the percentage of a person's earnings that goes toward paying their PhilHealth premiums to be covered under health insurance. Under the Universal Health Care Act, this rate is set to go up by half a percent each year, starting in 2021, until it gets to 5% in 2024 and 2025. Here's a breakdown of PhilHealth's contribution rates from 2019 to 2024/2025. Year Monthly Salary Basis Premium Rate Monthly Premium 2019 P10,000 2.75% P275 2019 P10,000.01 to P49,999.99 2.75% P275 to P1,375 2019 P50,000 2.75% P1,375 2020 P10,000 3% P300 2020 P10,000.01 to P59,999.99 3% P300 to P1,800 2020 P60,000 3% P1,800 2021 P10,000 3.50% P350 2021 P10,000.01 to P69,999.99 3.50% P350 to P2,450 2021 P70,000 3.50% P2,450 2022 P10,000 4% P400 2022 P10,000.01 to P79,999.99 4% P400 to P3,200 2022 P80,000 4% P3,200 2023 P10,000 4% P400 2023 P10,000.01 to P79,999.99 4% P400 to P3,200 2023 P80,000 4% P3,200 2024-2025 P10,000 5% P500 2024-2025 P10,000.01 to P99,999.99 5% P500 to P5,000 2024-2025 P100,000 5% P5,000 A table showing PhilHealth's monthly premium rates from 2019 to 2024/2025 computations. Computing Your Employee's PhilHealth Contribution in 2024 Let's now learn more about how to calculate an employee's monthly PhilHealth contribution with the new rates for 2024. Consider Employee A, who earns a monthly salary of P25,000. To determine their monthly premium with the new 5% rate, apply the following formula: Basic Salary x 5% (0.05) = Premium Rate Calculating Employee A's monthly PhilHealth contribution gives us: P25,000 x 0.05 = P1,250 To find out the contribution split, divide the monthly premium in half: P1,250 (Monthly premium) / 2 = P625 (Employee's share) As a result, both Employee A and their employer will contribute P625 each to PhilHealth every month. What Does the 5% PhilHealth Contribution Rate Increase Mean for Employers? The new 5% PhilHealth contribution rate for 2024 can have a huge impact on employers and employees. Here's what every employer should know: Compliance with Regulations and Avoidance of Penalties: Staying compliant with the updated PhilHealth regulations is crucial for employers if they want to protect their reputation and save money. Employers must properly deduct, remit correct premiums, and report payments to PhilHealth according to existing rules to avoid penalties under PhilHealth Circular 003-2015. PhilHealth can recover claim payments and unpaid premiums plus interest from delinquent, under-remitting, non-remitting, and non-reporting employers as per The Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations of the National Health Insurance Act of 2013. Claim Payments: These are the reimbursements PhilHealth makes for medical costs incurred by its members. Premiums: Regular contributions that employers are required to pay on behalf of their employees to maintain their PhilHealth coverage. Fines are Php5,000-10,000 x number of employees for non-compliance. PhilHealth can also pursue legal action for failure to comply. Employers must be diligent in applying the new rate to avoid such penalties to save costs and ensure they're following the legal requirements. Financial Planning and Budgeting: The contribution increase might impact the overall cost of employment and benefits budgets for businesses. Employers will have to account for the higher expense in their financial planning, possibly requiring adjustments to benefits packages or employee compensation to balance the additional cost. Employee Communication and Relations: Employers should communicate the changes in contribution rates to their employees clearly and effectively. Understanding the increase and its benefits can help maintain positive employee relations and ensure that employees are aware of and appreciate the value of their health benefits. Long-term Health Benefits and Employee Welfare: While there may be a short-term financial cost, the increase in Philhealth contributions is meant to strengthen the overall healthcare system. A better healthcare system means employees can access improved health services and facilities. As explained by Philhealth's spokesperson Kleah Gayle Guevara, the purpose is to expand Philhealth's programs, improve benefits, and ensure the corporation can sustain payments for member benefits. In the long run, having a healthier workforce through a robust public healthcare system can result in fewer sick days, higher productivity, and a more vibrant workplace environment for employees. So while there is an immediate cost, the goal is a healthcare system that supports community well-being over time. Payroll Processing Adjustments: Lastly, employers will need to update their payroll systems to reflect the new 5% contribution rate. This change requires recalculating the monthly health insurance deductions for each employee to ensure accurate withholdings and contributions. The increase may also necessitate payroll software updates or discussions with payroll service providers to implement these changes efficiently. Employers should take proactive steps to integrate these changes into their operations, communicate effectively with their workforce, and leverage the enhanced healthcare benefits for the betterment of their organization and employees. Frequently Asked Questions How Do I Pay My Philhealth Contributions? You have several options for payment, including through your employer (for those who are employed), direct payment at PhilHealth offices, online payment channels, or authorized collection agents. What Benefits Does Philhealth Offer? PhilHealth covers a wide range of health services, from hospital stays and surgeries to outpatient care and maternity services. They regularly update their benefit packages, so it's a good idea to check their website for the most current information. Can My Family Get Benefits from My PhilHealth Membership? Yes, your legal dependents -- like your spouse, children under 21 who aren't married or employed, and your parents over 60 -- can also benefit from your PhilHealth coverage. Can Members Continue Paying Into PhilHealth After They Retire? Yes, individuals who have retired can continue their PhilHealth membership by paying their monthly premiums as lifetime members. To qualify, the retiree needs to be at least 60 years old, which is the retirement age in the Philippines, and must have made at least 120 monthly contributions while they were working. What if I need to update my membership information? You can update your information by submitting a filled-out PMRF (PhilHealth Member Registration Form) at any PhilHealth office or through their online portal. It's important to keep your info up to date, especially if there are changes in your family status, address, or employment.

With this card, you can enjoy discounts and claim rewards from over 350 partner establishments nationwide. You can also use the Pag-IBIG Loyalty Card at restaurants, schools, and pharmacies, among others. Pag-IBIG first launched its loyalty program in 2014 to maximize the value of the working Filipino's Pag-IBIG membership. The government agency partnered with different establishments to offer exclusive discounts and perks to 12.77 million Pag-IBIG members nationwide (active membership as of December 31, 2020). Indeed, the Pag-IBIG Loyalty Card is more than just a Pag-IBIG ID. In a developing country like the Philippines, it offers considerable financial assistance to citizens who want the best value for their money. Pag-IBIG launched a revamped Loyalty Card in late 2019, giving it a whole new purpose. It introduced the Pag-IBIG Loyalty Card Plus, the agency's very own cash card, which members can use to receive the proceeds of a Pag-IBIG multi-purpose loan, MP2 dividends, and other Pag-IBIG benefits. The new Pag-IBIG Loyalty Card Plus comes with an EMV chip that has new banking features, so it doubles as an ATM card. The AUB card works the same as any prepaid card, wherein all deposited amounts aren't eligible to earn interest. Meanwhile, the Pag-IBIG Loyalty Card Plus from UnionBank works the same as any UnionBank ATM savings card, allowing users to earn interest on any outstanding balances. There are many reasons to get a Pag-IBIG Loyalty Card today. Here are some of them: Cash Card Functionality: Pag-IBIG partnered with UnionBank and Asia United Bank to develop Pag-IBIG Loyalty Card Plus's cash card functionality.

Year after year, the perks keep adding up! If this is your first time applying, you'll instantly receive the newer Pag-IBIG Loyalty Card Plus. If you currently own the old version of the loyalty card, you can still use it to get discounts from partner establishments. However, if you want to upgrade your card, you'll have to follow the steps for a new application. Prepare the following Pag-IBIG loyalty card requirements: Two valid IDs: One valid ID and its photocopy to be used during the application process and the other valid ID to be left with the guard upon entry. Take note that Pag-IBIG no longer considers Philhealth ID and TIN cards as valid IDs. Once you've secured your requirements for a Pag-IBIG Loyalty Card and your permanent Membership ID number, follow these Pag-IBIG Loyalty card application steps: Download the Pag-IBIG Loyalty Card Plus application form and fill it out. Submit the completed form to the nearest Pag-IBIG Fund branch. Pay the registration fee of P125 and keep the receipt for claiming.

        "Body": "As soon as a child is born, a Certificate of Live Birth (COLB) is created to log all the pertinent details of his birth. This COLB is reviewed and signed by the child's parents and is submitted to the Local Civil Registry Office of the city or municipality where the child was born. A birth record is then created for the child at that LCR and the COLB is endorsed to the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) for certification. The child is then issued a PSA Birth Certificate. Most, if not all, transactions in a person's lifetime will require him to present his PSA birth certificate. From the time he enters preschool, to taking college entrance exams and licensure exams, opening bank accounts, applying for a passport, and a whole lot of other milestones and key events. In the past, getting a copy of your PSA birth certificate means personally visiting a PSA office (formerly National Statistics Office or NSO), between Monday to Friday, during office hours. Now, you have the option to order online any time and have your PSA certificate delivered to your home or office. When the pandemic hit in 2020, more people found value (and wisdom!) in having essential needs brought to them instead of leaving their homes to fetch these needs themselves. Luckily, requesting for PSA birth certificate, marriage certificate, death certificate, and CENOMAR is included in the growing list of errands that can be done online for safety and security. How do I register my child's birth? Birth registration must be done within the 30-day reglementary period. A report made beyond 30 days from the date of birth is considered delayed and such will be marked on the person's birth certificate. Birth registration is done by submitting the duly accomplished copy of the Certificate of Live Birth along with the parents' PSA marriage certificate (if the parents are married), and other documents to the office of the Local Civil Registrar (LCR) in the city or municipality where the child was born. If you gave birth in a hospital, your child's birth registration will be submitted to the LCR by the hospital. If you gave birth at home, you must process the birth registration yourself, your spouse, or any member of your immediate family who is of legal age. The attendant at birth, such as the midwife or traditional midwife (hilot) may also process the birth registration. When can I get a copy of my newborn's PSA birth certificate? After your child's birth registration and other documents have been submitted to the LCR, you will be informed when you can get your personal copy of the Certificate of Live Birth. In case release is delayed, you may follow-up at the hospital where you gave birth or go directly to the LCR where your child's birth was registered. It takes two to four months from the time your child's birth details are submitted to the LCR before you can expect to have a copy of his PSA birth certificate. To be safe, start requesting for a copy of your child's PSA birth certificate after four months. You can order your child's PSA birth certificate online at PSAHelpline.ph and have the certificate delivered to you. You also have the option to personally request at a PSA outlet near your area. If you are in a hurry to get a PSA birth certificate for your child, you can opt for an Advance Endorsement where you personally have your child's Certificate of Live Birth authenticated at the municipal or health office of the place where you gave birth. After the Certificate of Live Birth is authenticated, you bring this to the PSA for electronic endorsement. Endorsing a copy of the Certificate of Live Birth (or Certificate of Marriage, and Certificate of Death) will require an endorsement or transmittal letter signed by the LCR office. The transmittal letter shall be given to you by the LCR so make sure to ask for this, in case you don't find it in your set of documents. Your child's PSA birth certificate shall be available after three weeks (instead of two to four months). How do I get a Certified True Copy of my Certificate of Live Birth? You can get a Certified True Copy of Certificate of Live Birth (COLB) at the Local Civil Registrar's office of the city of municipality where you were born. Proceed to the LCR office and provide your: Complete and registered name Birth date and birthplace Complete names of your parents The Registration Office shall check the availability of your COLB based on the details you submitted. If they have your COLB on file, you will be asked to proceed to the Municipal Treasurer to pay for the copy. Secure an Official Receipt after your payment. Rates may vary. Present the Official Receipt to the Municipal Civil Registrar and receive the certified copy of your birth certificate. Can I request for a copy of my PSA birth certificate online? Yes. Ordering your PSA birth certificate online is safe and convenient, especially now that our country is still reeling from the effects of COVID-19. You can request for a copy of your PSA birth certificate at PSAHelpline.ph When you order online, your PSA birth certificate (and other types of civil registry documents such as PSA marriage certificate, PSA death certificate, and PSA CENOMAR) is delivered to your doorstep wherever you are in the Philippines (subject, of course, to the courier's ability to locate and reach an address as some addresses are out of boundaries). How much will it cost to order for my PSA birth certificate online? At PSAHelpline.ph, you can get a copy of your PSA birth certificate, PSA marriage certificate, or a copy of a PSA death certificate for P365.00; a copy of a PSA CENOMAR is at P420.00. These already cover the processing and delivery fees to any location in the Philippines. Various payment options are made available for your convenience. You can pay online with your credit card, or through your GCash or PayMaya apps. You may also pay over the counter at PSAHelpline's partner banks and payment center affiliates. If you are ordering from Metro Manila, you will get your PSA birth certificate in three to four working days; provincial deliveries take three to eight working days to complete. How do I get my PSA birth certificate through walk-in application? Requesting for copy issuance of civil registry documents at PSA CRS outlets requires an online appointment. You may create an appointment at https://appointment.psa.gov.ph/. This is free of charge and is open to everyone. Can someone else request a copy of my PSA birth certificate? If you are ordering for your PSA birth certificate online, you can only request for yourself, your parent, or your child. If you are requesting for a copy issuance of your birth certificate at a PSA CRS outlet, you can order for yourself and your family members, and you can also get copies of the birth certificates of people other than your family and relatives. However, you need to present an authorization letter signed by the owner of the PSA birth certificate and his or her original valid ID. As an authorized representative, you are only allowed to request for up to two unrelated individuals. Does a PSA birth certificate expire?",

        "Title": "How to Report a Late Registration of Birth",
        "Body": "A child's birth must be registered at the Local Civil Registry office of the city or municipality where the child was born. This must be done no later than 30 days from the day the child was born; otherwise, the registration is deemed late or delayed. Unless a person's birth is properly registered, he or she will not be able to obtain a PSA birth certificate. A PSA birth certificate is a primary requirement in a lot of personal transactions such as applying for a passport for the first time, enrolling in school, filing insurance claims and inheritances, and some bank transactions. You may file a delayed registration of your birth certificate at the LCR of the city or municipality where you were born. Here are the requirements and processes involved, as lifted from the website of the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA): Requirements when filing Delayed Registration of Birth: If the person is a minor (less than 18 years old), please submit the following: Four copies of the Certificate of Live Birth duly accomplished and signed by the parties involved Duly accomplished Affidavit of Delayed Registration found at the back of the Certificate of Live Birth. This must be done by the father, mother, or guardian. The details needed are: Name of the child Date and place of birth Name of the father (if the child is illegitimate and father wants to acknowledge the child) Date and place of marriage of parents (if parents are married) Reason for not registering the child's birth within 30 days after the child's birth If the person is 18 years old or older: All the requirements mentioned for a minor birth certificate owner and Certificate of Marriage (if the person is already married). Where to file the late registration of birth? The late registration must be filed at the Office of the Civil Registrar of the place where the person was born. What are the processes involved? The application for delayed registration of birth shall be examined by the Civil Registrar, including the Certificate of Live Birth and other submitted documentary requirements. Posting of Pending Application The pending application for delayed registration shall be posted on the bulletin boards of the city or municipality where the birth occurred, as notice to the public. The notice shall be posted for 10 days. If after 10 days and the office of the LCR does not receive any disagreement on the registration, the LCR shall proceed with the evaluation of the documents submitted. If all goes well during the evaluation and verification, the LCR shall register the vital event (birth, marriage, or death). A vital event that is registered late shall be marked with red ink in the civil registry book. Likewise, the registry number on the certificate shall also be printed in red ink. The remarks, \"Delayed Registration\" shall appear on the upper right-hand margin of the birth certificate and \"Remarks\" portion of the registry book. You may inquire directly at the LCR office for the fees involved when filing a delayed registration of birth. When discussing fees, always make sure you are transacting with an employee or staff of the LCR office or the city hall and never with a fixer. For more information on delayed registration of vital events, you may visit the website of the PSA at https://psa.gov.ph/",

        "Title": "2024 Guide to PRC Renewal Requirements and Application",
        "Body": "In this article: How to Renew Your PRC ID What to Prepare Before Your Renewal Appointment Day Common Concerns and Questions About PRC ID Renewal A Professional Regulation Commission (PRC) license or PRC ID is proof that you can legally practice your profession in the Philippines. It needs to be renewed every three years to avoid disruptions in your practice. Time to renew your license? Follow this step-by-step guide to the PRC renewal requirements and application process. How to Renew Your PRC ID Good news: the bulk of the renewal process is done online. This includes scheduling your appointment for a personal appearance at a PRC office. Make sure you have a strong internet connection before you start your application. A poor connection may cause pages to load slowly or require you to restart your form. Step 1: Create a LERIS account. You need an account on PRC's LERIS (Licensure Examination and Registration System). If you already have one, skip to Step 2. Go to online.prc.gov.ph. Under the \"Register\" tab, click \"I Agree\" after reading the terms and conditions. Fill out the required fields, including the password that you'll use to sign in to LERIS after registration. Confirm your details and agree to another set of terms and conditions. You'll see a prompt to log into your LERIS account. After login, check your email to verify your email address with an OTP (one-time password). If you see a pop-up saying the OTP is disabled, LERIS should still proceed with your account registration. Step 2: Complete your personal information. Once you have a LERIS account, fill out the personal information on your profile to begin your renewal application. Go to the valid ID section and click the box for PRC ID renewal. The ID fields will be automatically disabled. Click \"Save Information.\" Review your personal information then proceed to the next step. Step 3: Upload a recent passport photo. An updated photo is a critical PRC renewal requirement. Follow the PRC's photo guidelines: Size: Passport size (2x2 inches), colored, and shot against a plain white background with no shadows Time: Taken within the last six months Pose: Your face should be visible and directly facing the camera. Don't tilt your head. Make sure your ears are visible. Clothing: Wear a collared top with sleeves (think business attire). Don't wear glasses. Step 4: Go to \"Select Transaction\" of your LERIS account. After uploading a photo, click \"Select Transaction\" (item 1 on the screenshot above). Select \"Renewal Tab\" (2) among transactions. Choose your profession (3), provide your license number (4), and click to proceed (5). Step 5: Schedule your face-to-face appointment. Select the PRC regional branch where you want to claim your PRC ID. Once you do so, LERIS automatically fills the fields for \"Branch\" and the available \"Scheduled Date and Time.\" However, you can check other options and make changes. After choosing a branch and a date, your PRC license's new expiration date and renewal fees will appear. Step 6: Review the PRC renewal fee. Renewal fees are P450 if you have a bachelor's degree or P420 if you don't. If fees are higher than you expected, note that the PRC imposes a surcharge for an expired license. Step 7: Pay the PRC renewal fee via GCash. LERIS provides several payment channels, but e-wallets like GCash only charge an P8 convenience fee on top of the renewal fee. After choosing GCash, you'll receive one final review of your application details. Click \"Submit Application\" and follow GCash's payment instructions. Once you complete payment, you're done with the online application phase of your professional license renewal! What to Prepare Before Your Renewal Appointment Day PRC will release your PRC ID on the day of your appointment once you satisfy all its requirements. Prepare to submit the following: PRC Renewal Application Form Download and print your application form from the \"Existing Transactions\" section of your LERIS account. You should also see your appointment details and electronic receipt, which you can print and bring. Certificates of Attendance for CPD To renew your PRC license, you need to earn at least 15 Continuing Professional Development (CPD) units or points through training or learning seminars. The CPD points should be validated by the CPD Accreditation System (CPDAS). During your appointment, show a screenshot or printout of the dashboard of your CPDAS account. You can continue your renewal and obtain your ID even if you lack CPD units, since the PRC extended the deadline to December 31, 2024. Missing CPD obligations are carried over to the next renewal period. For example, if you have 10 missing CPD units, you must have 25 CPD points by the next renewal cycle. Certificate of Good Standing and Other Documents PRC may require some professions to provide additional certification and authentication documents, such as a Certificate of Good Standing or Surety Bond. Some certificates can be accomplished on LERIS. Common Concerns and Questions About PRC ID Renewal Can I renew before my PRC ID expires? You can apply for a renewal in advance. If you wait until it expires, you'll pay a surcharge, which increases over time. For example, if you renew 20 days after the expiration date, the surcharge is P30 (bachelor's degree) or P28 (non-bachelor's degree). Can I have my PRC ID delivered to my home? The shipping service is not currently available. For now, you must schedule an appointment. I' m an Overseas Filipino Professional (OFP) and can't make a personal appearance. How can I complete my application? Send a representative with an authorization letter with your signature and a photocopy of your PRC ID. Instead of CPD certificates, they should show photocopies of any of the following documents: Overseas Employment Certificate (OEC) from POEA Passport and working visa or permit Employment contract Company ID in a foreign country Residence permit How can I contact PRC? If you have concerns about your profession's PRC renewal requirements, call the PRC Helpdesk at 8736-2253 during office hours. Make sure you're also visiting official channels. PRC has one website and one social media account. Check below for the correct pages. PRC official website LERIS CPDAS Facebook Why do I get a \"Can't reach the page\" message when I visit the PRC website? Your browser may show a \"Page Unresponsive\" message when a web page takes too long to load or fails to load. Refreshing the page or clearing your browser cache can solve the error. A slow internet speed or an exceeded data cap can also affect page loading, especially if several devices connect to your home network.

        "Title": "How to Replace a Lost PRC ID: 2024 Guide",
        "Body": "The PRC ID is one of the most significant identification cards in your wallet right now if you are working in the Philippines as a professional. You cannot practice your profession without it. Your Professional Identification Card (PIC) proves that you are a qualified individual who has satisfied particular educational standards and passed the licensure exams. But what if it is lost or stolen? Do you have to reapply for your professional license all over again? Losing your license is inconvenient, but replacing it is simple and much less expensive than you might think. In this article, we'll go over the steps you'll need to follow to get a duplicate of your PRC license. What are the Requirements to Replace a PRC ID? To push through with the duplication of your lost PRC ID, you need the following documents: Notarized Affidavit of loss (if lost) A government-issued ID (driver's license, UMID, passport) 250 pesos fee A PRC LERIS Account Passport-sized photo with white background; collared shirt ( if you still do not have a LERIS Account) Special Power of Attorney and valid ID if filed through an authorized representative. How to Replace a Lost/Stolen PRC ID? Doing business with the PRC used to entail manually submitting all of the requirements and waiting in long lines at the cashier window. Fortunately, with the widespread use of computers and smartphones, the PRC is now implementing the Licensure Examination and Registration Information System, or LERIS. It effectively removed several transactions, allowing the PRC to accommodate more applicants with fewer resources. All of the problems with the old system have been significantly reduced, if not eliminated. Before visiting the PRC to replace a lost ID, you must first schedule an appointment using LERIS. It is required because the PRC no longer accepts walk-in applications. To secure an appointment, please follow the procedure below. Keep in mind that you cannot duplicate your PRC ID if its expiration date is less than a year. This is because it would be impractical for both you and the PRC. You would have to return to the PRC for your license renewal soon after getting your duplicate ID. This would waste resources and cause inconvenience for you. If you lost your license card less than a year from its expiration date, just do a PRC card renewal. You can renew it as early as 10 months before it expires. 1. Log in to LERIS To access the LERIS portal, go to https://online.prc.gov.ph/ using a computer with a good internet connection. Enter your login credentials after clicking the sign-in button. If you haven't already done so, go ahead and register for a LERIS account. Please include a recent photograph of yourself and complete all required fields. 2. Select Transaction On the right side of the page, click the large blue SELECT TRANSACTION button. A pop-up window will appear asking you to select your preferred transaction. Click the DUPLICATE tab then select your profession using the drop-down menu. Enter your PRC License Number then click proceed. 3. Select the PRC Office You will now be redirected to the appointment page. Please select your preferred PRC Regional Office from the drop-down menu where you intend to conduct your transaction. Click the PROCEED button to continue. 4. Pay the Duplicate Fee Select a method of payment to complete the transaction. If you do not want to pay transaction fees, pay at the cashier of the PRC office of your choice on the day of your scheduled appointment. Otherwise, select one of the available online payment methods. If you have a debit or credit card, a GCash, or a Maya account, these payment options are cheaper as you will only incur an additional 8 pesos in addition to the duplicate fee of 250 pesos. 5. Print the Application Form After completing the payment, you will be redirected to the Existing Transactions tab. Here, you will see your appointment details and the status of your payment, if it has already been posted or not. Click the Print Document button. A prompt will appear asking you to download the file. Download the application form and save it to your hard drive or a USB storage device. 6. Go to the PRC Office Go to your preferred PRC Regional Office on your scheduled date and time. Submit a printed copy of your application form along with your Affidavit of Loss and valid identification card. Depending on the number of applications, the PRC usually releases the duplicate ID within the day. Frequently Asked Questions Here are the most commonly asked questions about the process of replacing a lost or stolen PRC ID license. Q: Can I apply for a duplicate anytime? A: No. You cannot duplicate your PRC ID if its expiration date is less than a year. Q: Do I have to pay for the appointment? A: No. Getting an appointment using the PRC LERIS is free. Be wary of fixers who offer services to transact with PRC for a fee. Q: How much is the fee for the duplicate PRC ID? A: The application fee is P250.00 and an additional 8 pesos convenience fee if paid online using GCash, Maya, debit, or credit card. Q: How long does it take to get a copy of the Professional Identification Card (PIC)? A: Duplicate professional identification card is released within the day. Q: I am an OFW and I cannot personally get the ID card. What should I do? A: Provide a Special Power of Attorney and valid ID if the application is filed through an authorized representative.

Applying for a duplicate PRC license ID is a relatively simple process. Be sure to have all the required documents and information on hand before starting the application. Following the above instructions will make the process go more smoothly. Have a hassle-free application process!",

        "Title": "BIR Registration: An Online and In-Person Guide to New Business Registration with BIR",
        "Body": "In the Philippines, registration with the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) is one of the first and most crucial steps to formalize your business and ensure compliance with local tax laws and regulations. Completing your BIR registration provides you a tax identification number (TIN), a nine-digit number to help BIR identify and track your company's tax activities. You will also receive a BIR Certificate of Registration, Books of Account, and Authority to Print, which are important documentary requirements to securing financial services for your business, attracting paying clients, and availing government benefits or tax credits. Why should you register your business with BIR? BIR registration is a critical step in legitimizing a business, as it allows the company to legally issue official receipts, file taxes, and avail of tax credits or deductions. It also helps the government monitor and collect taxes which are essential for funding public services and infrastructure. The BIR registration process ensures that businesses contribute to the national economy through proper tax collection, thereby playing a key role in the country's development and governance. Compliance with BIR requirements also protects businesses from penalties, fines, or legal issues associated with tax evasion or non-compliance. Which businesses are required to complete BIR Registration? All types of Philippine businesses are required to register with the BIR -- whether they are set up by a sole proprietor, a partnership (professional, general, or limited), or a corporation (stock or non-stock). For sole proprietorships, mixed-income earners, and freelancers, BIR registration must be your first step prior to launching your business. Meanwhile, for corporations and partnerships, BIR registration is the next step after completing registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), since one of the BIR registration requirements is your SEC Certificate of Registration.

After receiving your Certificate of Registration, you will be required to complete the Application for Authority to Print Receipts and Invoices. You'll need the BIR Form 1906 to register your books of account and attend the taxpayer's initial briefing. BIR registration online via NewBizReg Portal If the idea of doing all those makes you cringe, BIR registration online is now available via the NewBizReg Portal. This BIR e-registration system lets you send your application, documents, and fees via email. According to BIR, your application shall be processed manually within three (3) working days from the date of email acknowledgement receipt of your documents.

Compliance is not only the reason your company needs to register with the BIR. Here are the main reasons to get registered as soon as possible. Avoid Fines and Jail Time Operating an unregistered business hurts your reputation, and carries financial penalties. For businesses operating in matters of public health and safety, operating without a license may equate to a prison sentence. Get Approved for Loans and Other Financial Services BIR registration is important if you want to apply for funding and financial services. For instance, to open a corporate bank account, you'll need a TIN and BIR Certificate of Registration. You'll also need to be registered if you intend to apply for a bank loan or other types of financing. First Circle, for example, will only underwrite your business for a Revolving Credit Line if it is BIR-registered. More Business Opportunities Having a solid financial and legal reputation means you are reliable when it comes to compliance and supplier payments. This offers you opportunities to land new clients or find business services and supplies at more affordable prices. It will also be easier to explore opportunities in untapped sectors or markets, submit bids for government contracts, or even export your products. Contribute to Society More than half of the government's revenues come from the BIR's collections, which are used to fund government services and improve the country's assets and infrastructure. People often complain about taxes, but they are essential in financing government activities that aim to uplift citizens' lives.   BIR business registration is one of the important steps to legalize your business. Doing so means you get to conduct your business legitimately, showing customers and government agencies that you are compliant with business requirements and regulations.

        "Title": "Marriage Registration Philippines: How to Register Your Marriage in the Philippines",
        "Body": "The proposal has happened, and it's time to start preparing for the big day. While planning the wedding can be all bells and whistles, there are certain documents and paperwork that need to be done for your union to be signed, sealed, and delivered. Yes, we're talking about the marriage license and certificate, which are all needed so your marriage will be registered and legal. In the Philippines, there are certain requirements and procedures that need to be accomplished before you even think about your wedding day. So what does it take to have your marriage registered in the Philippines? Let's first discuss what a marriage license and a marriage certificate are. ### What is a Marriage License? A marriage license is considered to be the most important document required for a couple to be allowed to marry in the Philippines. No church, judiciary, or officiant will allow you to marry without this license. You can apply for your marriage license from the local registry office from where one of you habitually resides. The license is a piece of document stating that both of you are allowed to get married under the Philippine government law. ### What is a Marriage Certificate? The marriage certificate is the document that states your legal contract with each other. The document is a social and legal contract between two individuals that serve as a legal, economic, and emotional agreement. You will need these documents so you can register your marriage in the Philippines. So now let's proceed to the process by which you can acquire these two documents. ### Marriage Registration Process for Filipino-Filipino Partners **Step 1: Apply for a Marriage License** Both parties must visit the local civil registrar's office in the city or town where one of you habitually resides. Apply for a marriage license, provided that the following requisites are met by both parties: - Both parties are female and male in gender. - Both parties are at least 18 years old and above. - Both parties are not related by blood up to the 4th degree. - Both parties are Philippine citizens. - Both parties have a certificate of Family Planning and Marriage seminar from the local city Social Welfare Services office. The following documents must also be provided: - Application Form - Community Tax Certificate (Cedula) - Recent 1x1 Photo - PSA (formerly NSO) Authenticated birth certificate - CENOMAR (Certificate of No Marriage Record) Important Notes: - If one or both partners have been married before, additional documents are required. - If the marrying couple is between the ages of 18 to 21, a written and notarized parental consent must be submitted with the documents; if the marrying couple is between the ages of 22 to 24, a notarized received parental advice must be submitted with the documents. - If the marrying couple does not have a certificate of Family Planning and Marriage, the release of the marriage license will be delayed up to 3 months. Once the requirements are submitted, along with the application form for the marriage license, you will have to wait 10 business days or 2 weeks for the document to be issued. Once you have the marriage license, you can then proceed with the marriage ceremony. The marriage license must be used within 120 days from the issuance; otherwise, it will be deemed null and void. **Step 2: Get Married** A marriage ceremony must be officiated by a member of the local judiciary, which includes: priests, imams, rabbis, consul generals, or ministers of registered churches or religious sects. The place of the ceremony must be in a court or church. Exceptions are made when the location of the ceremony is far from the nearest court or church, or if the religious sect or priest allows it. After the wedding vows and traditions are done, the marriage certificate must be signed by the marrying couple, as well as signed by the officiant, and two witnesses, both of legal age. **Step 3: Register the Marriage Certificate** Within 15 days of the marriage certificate signing, the document must be forwarded to the city hall and registered at the local civil registry office where the marriage or wedding took place. ### Marriage Registration Process for Filipino-Foreigner Partners The steps to registering your marriage in the Philippines if one of you is a Filipino and the other is a foreigner is basically the same, except for one important piece of document required from the foreign partner. This document is called the Certificate of Legal Capacity to Contract Marriage. This document is issued by the consular representative of the foreign national's home country or the country of his/her citizenship. The Philippine government requires this document to all foreign nationals who wish to marry a Filipino in the Philippines to confirm that the said foreign national is not legally married to someone else. Once the Certificate of Legal Capacity to Contract Marriage is ready, all the necessary steps to acquiring the marriage license and marriage certificate must be complied with for the marriage to be registered in the Philippines. ### Marriage Registration for Foreigner-Foreigner Partners Two foreign nationals who want to get married and register their marriage in the Philippines are advised to consult with a lawyer as the government rule regarding this may change anytime. However, if both foreign nationals are residents of the Philippines, they can request to have their marriage registered at their respective embassy or consulate located in the Philippines. Most foreigners who have their wedding ceremony in the Philippines have the celebration in the country but register their wedding certificate in their place of origin. Foreign nationals can have their civil wedding in their home country before or after the ceremony taking place in the Philippines. The marriage license and marriage certificate are two of the most important documents you'll need to have your union legalized. While they may take a lengthy process to acquire and accomplish, once you've completed them, the next steps to think about will be your wedding day, and of course, the rest of your lives together. Disclaimer: The process and requirements mentioned above are according to the Philippine law and subject to change without prior notice.",
